<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>
<p>This story is complete in itself but forms the
fifth volume in a line issued under the general title
of &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have mentioned several times, this series
was started at the solicitation of those who had
read some of my &ldquo;Rover Boys&rdquo; books and who
wanted to know something about what took place
at Putnam Hall military academy before the
Rovers went there.</p>
<p>In my first volume, called, &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Cadets,&rdquo; I told how Captain Putnam happened
to organize that famous school, and how Jack
Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore came to be among
his first pupils. The boys made a host of friends
and also some enemies, and proved their worth
on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>In the second volume, &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Rivals,&rdquo; I related the outcome of several contests
on the field of sports, and also gave the particulars
of a thrilling balloon ride and of a strange discovery
in the woods. Then came &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Champions,&rdquo; with more contests, in one of
which Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s enemies played him a foul
trick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>Ever since the opening of the school there had
been trouble with an overbearing teacher named
Crabtree. When Crabtree and another teacher
were left in sole charge of the school during the
master&rsquo;s absence, this trouble reached its climax,
as related in &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rebellion.&rdquo;
The boys ran away and would not go back to
school until Captain Putnam appeared to smooth
matters out.</p>
<p>In the present volume are related the things
that occurred during a long encampment, when
the cadets marched from the academy to a beautiful
spot on the shore of a lake. Not far away
was an old mill, and at this place some of the lads
fell in with a most unusual mystery. What that
mystery was, and what it led to, I leave the pages
which follow to explain.</p>
<p>Again I thank my former readers, young and
old, for the nice things they have said about my
stories. I trust the present volume affords you
equal pleasure in the reading.</p>
<p><span class="center">Affectionately and sincerely yours,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Arthur M. Winfield</span>.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h1 title="">THE PUTNAM HALL ENCAMPMENT</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">IN THE BELFRY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now, Pepper?&rdquo; demanded
Major Jack Ruddy, for the cry was a startling
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are locked in!&rdquo; answered Pepper Ditmore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked in?&rdquo; repeated the young major of the
Putnam Hall battalion. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that the trap door is fastened. I can&rsquo;t
budge it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it must be stuck,&rdquo; said Jack, as he started
to climb down a ladder upon which he stood.
&ldquo;Why, there is nobody in the belfry but ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure of that, Jack. Some of the
other fellows may have followed us,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. He was down on his knees on the floor,
pulling at an iron ring with all his strength.
&ldquo;Maybe you want to try this,&rdquo; he added, as he
gave an additional tug.</p>
<p>The young major of the school cadets leaped
from the bottom of the ladder and took hold of
the iron ring, which was set in the edge of a heavy
trap door. He pulled with might and main, but
the trap door refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular tug-of-war!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Say, if we
can&rsquo;t get this door open what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way out of the belfry, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&mdash;unless we climb out of one of
the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! I don&rsquo;t care to risk my neck in that
manner.&rdquo; And Jack Ruddy gave a slight shiver
as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to get out somehow,&rdquo; continued
Pepper, making a wry face. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want to stay here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If some of the other fellows played this trick
on us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be hammered for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. Maybe it was Reff Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s so! Don&rsquo;t you remember, we saw
him and his cronies on their way to the Hall
when we came here? Maybe they followed us,
came up the stairs on the sly, and bolted the trap
from the under side. I shut the door myself&mdash;so
that we wouldn&rsquo;t fall through the hole in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if Reff Ritter &amp; Company did this thing
we&rsquo;ll have an account to settle with them&mdash;when
we get free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. But before we talk about getting
square let us get this trap door open and get
out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene was the tall tower of a village church.
The time was about nine o&rsquo;clock of a fine moon-light
night, and on all sides everything was quiet
and serene.</p>
<p>An hour before, the two boys already introduced
had left the school which they attended on
a &ldquo;dare&rdquo; from some of their chums. The dare involved
visiting the Cedarville Union Church.
The boys were to steal into the edifice by way of
a side window, usually left open to admit fresh
air. They were to make their way into the
gallery and thence to the tower where hung a big
bell. They were to remove the clapper of the bell
and bring it back to the school with them. If they
accomplished the feat the other students were to
get up a feast in their honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>To those who have read the previous volumes
of this &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series&rdquo; the two lads will
need no special introduction. But for the benefit
of others let me state that Jack Ruddy and Pepper
Ditmore were chums living, when at home, in the
western part of New York state. Jack was a little
the older of the two, and was of a more or less
serious turn of mind. Pepper was full of fun,
and was frequently called The Imp, a nickname
that fitted him well.</p>
<p>As related in the first volume of this series,
called &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo; the boys had
been sent to a new institution of learning, located
on Cayuga Lake. This military academy was
presided over by Captain Victor Putnam, a retired
army officer, who ran the place somewhat on
the lines of our National school at West Point.
The place was a large one, consisting of the school
building proper, the gymnasium, the boathouse,
and several other buildings. The captain was a
strict disciplinarian, but he had a kindly manner
about him, and the majority of the students liked
him very much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>When Jack and Pepper came to the Hall everything
was, of course, new to them. But it did not
take them long to make some good friends, including
Andy Snow, who was of an acrobatic turn,
Stuffer Singleton, who preferred eating to studying,
Dale Blackmore, who was a great football
player, Joseph Hogan, who, because of his Irish
accent, was usually called Emerald, and Joe
Nelson, a lad who was the best scholar in the
academy. They also made some enemies, including
Reff Ritter, already mentioned by them, and
his cronies, Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton.</p>
<p>At first the cadets were given their regular
school studies and taught how to drill and march,
but when they could do creditable duty as cadets
Captain Putnam allowed them to ballot for their
officers. This election resulted in Jack becoming
major of the Putnam Hall Battalion, with Henry
Lee captain of Company A and Bart Conners
captain of Company B. Jack wanted Pepper to
try for an officer&rsquo;s position, but The Imp declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll continue to be a high private in the rear
rank,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a wink. &ldquo;I can have
more fun that way&mdash;especially if I have a major
over me who knows when to keep his eyes shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I expect to have fun myself, even
if I am a major,&rdquo; had been Jack&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>There had been a keen contest over the election
of officers. An overbearing youth named Dan
Baxter had wanted to be major, and he had bribed
Gus Coulter and some others to vote for him, but
without success. Baxter was now away on a
vacation, and Jack and Pepper hoped he would
remain away for good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Following the election of officers, the chums
had had several adventures, not the least of which
was their aiding in the rescue of George Strong,
one of the teachers, who had been made a prisoner
in a hut in the woods by some insane relatives.</p>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s ancestry dated back to the Revolution,
and he told the boys of a treasure buried
by his relatives during war times. How the lads
unearthed the treasure has been related in detail
in the second volume of this series entitled,
&ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the coming of summer, the cadets turned
their attention to sports in the field and on the
lake. Jack&rsquo;s uncle had presented him with a fine
sloop, and in this the youthful major sailed
several races, as told about in &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Champions.&rdquo; The boys also had a bicycle race
and a hill-climbing contest, and likewise went
bowling against a rival institution of learning
called Pornell Academy. At Pornell at the time
was a youth named Fred Century, but this lad
became so disgusted at the actions of some of the
boys, and at Doctor Pornell, that he left the school
and came to Putnam Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>As time went on Reff Ritter showed up as the
worst boy at Putnam Hall. He did all in his
power to get Jack and Pepper and their chums
into trouble, and even dosed the young major with
some French powders that made Jack violently
sick. But this trick was eventually exposed and
Ritter came close to being expelled. It was Jack
who asked Captain Putnam to give the wayward
youth another chance to reform, but Ritter did
not appreciate his rival&rsquo;s generosity.</p>
<p>For a short while matters ran along smoothly
at Putnam Hall, but then came a happening far
out of the ordinary, as related in full in &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Rebellion.&rdquo; During the absence of the
head of the institution, and of George Strong, the
Hall was left in charge of Josiah Crabtree, a
teacher hated by nearly all the cadets, and a new
assistant named Cuddle. Cuddle was a peculiar
man who did not believe in hearty food for boys,
and he almost starved the cadets, so that they had
to rebel. For this they were locked in their dormitories.
But they escaped at night, and went
off to camp in the woods. Here the crowd split in
two, Reff Ritter heading the insurgents. Ritter
did all he could to annoy the crowd under Jack,
and there might have been a pitched battle had not
Captain Putnam put in an appearance. He made
the cadets march back to the Hall, and there held
some interesting interviews with all connected
with the rebellion. As a consequence the students
were allowed to return to their studies and Cuddle
was pre-emptorially dismissed from the institution,
while Josiah Crabtree escaped with a lecture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The Ritter crowd did not come back to the Hall
until after a severe storm had drenched all to the
skin. They were in far from a good humor and
many of them blamed Reff for the discomforts
they had suffered, and gave their former crony
the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all that Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; growled
Ritter. &ldquo;He and Pep Ditmore want to run everything.
If I had had my say from the start we
would have had a fine time.&rdquo; But only Coulter,
Paxton and a few others believed this. The others
said very frankly they thought Ritter had made a
mess of it when he got them to run away from the
main body of the rebelling cadets.</p>
<p>With the return of Captain Putnam and
George Strong, the students settled down once
more to their studies. The dictatorial Josiah
Crabtree was, for the time being, much subdued,
yet the cadets knew that sooner or later he would
become as harsh as ever. The one point in his
favor was that he was a learned man and could
teach well when he put his mind to it.</p>
<p>It was Andy Snow who had proposed the trip
to the belfry of the Cedarville church, located
about a mile and a half from the Hall. He had
dared Jack and Pepper to make the trip with
him, and the talk had been taken up by Stuffer
Singleton, Fred Century, Dale Blackmore, and
half a dozen others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t dare to do it,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bet an apple pie on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll wager ice-cream for the crowd,&rdquo;
added Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With most of the ice-cream for Stuffer himself,&rdquo;
put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to try it,&rdquo; declared Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;We owe the sexton
of that church one anyway, for chasing us
from Mr. Dalter&rsquo;s orchard when he had no right
to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get the clapper and hide it in old Crabtree&rsquo;s
bed,&rdquo; said Andy. But just then he was
called away by one of the monitors. Then he sent
a note back stating Captain Putnam wished him
to do an errand, so he could not make the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that ends it,&rdquo; said Dale Blackmore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody dares to go,&rdquo; said another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Pepper promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;But mum&rsquo;s
the word, remember. We don&rsquo;t want any of the
teachers to learn what is going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be as silent as oysters in a stew,&rdquo; said
Stuffer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; &rsquo;twill be a great sphort to put the
clapper in ould Crabtree&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; said Emerald
Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is going to do that?&rdquo; asked another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;if Pep and Jack get the clapper,&rdquo;
answered the Irish cadet promptly.</p>
<p>A little later Jack and Pepper set off on their
quest, stealing away from Putnam Hall campus
unobserved. They got half way to the church and
then passed Reff Ritter and his cronies, who went
by without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is dead easy,&rdquo; remarked Jack, as they
climbed in the church window. They had a lantern
with them, and lighting this, mounted the
stairs to the gallery, and then ascended the long
ladder leading to the belfry floor. Here they
opened the trap door and then closed it again, as
already stated.</p>
<p>The bell was close at hand and it was a comparatively
easy matter to detach the iron clapper.
Pepper came down the ladder with it and then
made the startling discovery with which our story
opens. The trap door had been bolted from the
under side and the two cadets were prisoners in
the belfry, at a distance of seventy-five feet from
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">JACK IN PERIL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for it, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem, Pep. Do you really think
Reff Ritter and his crowd came back here and
fastened the trap door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Reff came back. I don&rsquo;t know about
the others. You&rsquo;ll remember Reff is just aching
to do something to get us into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can&rsquo;t pry the door up in some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try. But what is there to work with?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Cautiously the two cadets allowed the light
from the lantern to flash around the interior of the
belfry. They had to be careful, for fear somebody
below would see the light and wonder what it
meant, for the belfry was never illuminated. An
investigation by the sexton or some officers of the
church might lead to arrest. Once some students
from Pornell Academy had painted the porch of
the church red and this had caused a great commotion
in the community, and arrests might have
been made had not one of the pupils&rsquo; fathers come
forward, paid for repainting the porch, and made
the church a handsome donation in the bargain.
But even with this, some folks were still &ldquo;sore,&rdquo;
and ready to pounce down on any boys who might
do the property an injury.</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper knew well enough that they
had no right to touch the bell clapper, and I am
not upholding them in their actions. But they
were wide-awake boys, always ready for fun, and
saw no great harm in what they proposed to do.
Sooner or later the clapper would be returned to
its proper place&mdash;in fact it looked now as if it
would be returned much quicker than originally
intended.</p>
<p>The two boys allowed the rays from the lantern
to sweep the floor and walls of the belfry, but
without bringing to view anything with which to
pry up the trap door. Then they set the lantern
down and both got hold of the iron ring in the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull with all your might!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here goes!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Both gave &ldquo;a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull
altogether.&rdquo; At first there was no result, then of
a sudden the iron ring broke from the door. The
cadets were not prepared for this, and over both
went backwards. Pepper landed on the lantern,
knocking it over and breaking the glass and bending
the top. Fortunately the light went out, so
there was no danger of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; spluttered the mischievous youth, as
he rolled over. &ldquo;Oh, what luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; questioned the young major
quickly. &ldquo;Did the glass cut you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not, but I&rsquo;ve got some of it in my
jacket, Jack. I didn&rsquo;t think the ring would break
away like that; did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broken glass had scattered all over the floor
and the belfry was now dark excepting for the
light from the moon that shone in the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a match?&rdquo; asked Jack, after a brief pause,
during which he searched his pockets in vain for
what he wanted.</p>
<p>His chum felt in first one pocket and then
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a one,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the
use anyway? The lantern is busted, we can&rsquo;t use
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get a little light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t even a piece of a match. I
meant to bring a pocketful, but I forgot it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>With caution, the two cadets moved around the
now semi-dark belfry. At every step the glass
crunched under their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the ring gone we can&rsquo;t get any hold on
the trap door,&rdquo; sighed Pepper. &ldquo;Jack, it looks
as if we were booked to stay here for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. But don&rsquo;t you think the others will
come to our aid, if we don&rsquo;t get back to the Hall
soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;but they may wait longer than we
want them to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can&rsquo;t climb down from the outside?
We could use the bell rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys approached the window into which
the moonlight was streaming and peered out. All
they could see was the church roof and the roadway
some distance from the building, for the edge
of the roof cut off a sight of the ground directly
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try the rope,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had Andy along he&rsquo;d go down the
rope like a monkey,&rdquo; returned Pepper, remembering
Andy Snow&rsquo;s acrobatic cleverness.</p>
<p>The bell rope ran from the bell down through
a hole in the floor to the lower vestibule of the
church. The boys pulled on it and it came up a
length of probably sixty feet. Then it stuck fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a knot in it, too big to slip through
the hole,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s comment, after both had
pulled with all their might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there is enough of it anyway,&rdquo;
answered the young major. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut it off and
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do that we may have to pay for a new
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the rope can be spliced. Maybe it&rsquo;s
spliced already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack got out his knife and the rope was soon cut
in two. They heard the lower end drop down to
a flooring below.</p>
<p>Making certain that the top end of the rope was
well secured to the bell, so that it could not break
away, and testing the strands to see if they would
sustain his weight, Jack, aided by Pepper, lowered
the rope out of the front window, first, however,
putting several knots in it. It slid down
over the edge of the roof and both boys kept
lowering it until there was no more to pay out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the great climb!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young major of the Putnam Hall cadets. &ldquo;If I
get down safely, Pepper, I&rsquo;ll be up in a jiffy and
open that trap door for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Jack. I rather hate to see you
trust yourself on that rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it is safe enough&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve gone
down on a rope in the gym many a time, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With caution Jack climbed out of the belfry
window and took hold of the rope. Then down he
went, hand under hand, with his legs twisted
around the rope at the same time. Pepper
watched him with keen interest and almost held
his breath as he saw his chum disappear over the
edge of the broad-guttered roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a pretty big drop I&rsquo;m thinking, if
that rope doesn&rsquo;t reach,&rdquo; mused The Imp, as he
waited in the belfry. &ldquo;We ought to have measured
the rope&mdash;to see how long it was. Maybe it
won&rsquo;t come to within twenty feet of the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes passed&mdash;they seemed hours to
Pepper&mdash;and he waited anxiously for some call
from his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Are you down?&rdquo; he cried finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the surprising answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
stuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A knot on the lower end of the rope has
caught on some kind of a brace, and I&rsquo;m stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down here, on the front of the church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you climb back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, I&mdash;ain&rsquo;t go&mdash;got th&mdash;the&mdash;strength!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The words came in jerks and showed that the
young major was all but exhausted. He had done
what he could to loosen the lower end of the rope
but without success. Climbing back to the tower
had proved equally difficult. Now he was sitting
astride of the rope, clutching it with both hands
and leaning against the building for support.</p>
<p>Pepper was frantic, but could do nothing to aid
his chum. Had the lower end of the rope been
loose he might have raised Jack to the belfry. He
climbed out of the window as far as he dared and
looked over the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, can I do anything?&rdquo; he asked, frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the gasped-out
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get that end of the rope loose somehow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t budge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made Pepper a little dizzy to look directly
downward over the edge of the gutter and for a
moment he allowed his gaze to stray to the roadway
beyond the church. In the moonlight he saw
the figure of a man or boy approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes somebody!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to call for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be caught,&rdquo; faltered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I am not going to keep quiet and
see you run the risk of breaking your neck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Pepper set up a loud call. At first the person
in the road paid no attention, but presently he
stopped short and looked upward in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked, as he came
closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in trouble and we want you to help
us,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Hurry up, before my
friend tumbles down and kills himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are on a rope, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
the person below, and now Pepper and Jack saw
that he was a boy, very tall and thin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am caught fast,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get there, this time of night?
What do you want me to do?&rdquo; fired back the tall
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the church, run up to the belfry,
and unfasten the trap door!&rdquo; called Pepper. &ldquo;I
am a prisoner, otherwise I&rsquo;d go to my friend&rsquo;s
aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get in?&rdquo; asked the strange boy,
noting that the church doors were closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb through the side window which is
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer started for the side of the building,
but suddenly halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, this is a mighty queer proceedings,&rdquo;
he said slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what you are
thieves. Maybe I had better go for outside help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are not thieves&mdash;we are military school
cadets, out on a lark,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you see my uniform? Help me to get down and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can see your buttons,&rdquo; answered the
tall boy, and without another word he ran for the
window and disappeared inside the church. He
knocked around in the darkness but soon found
the way upstairs and to the belfry ladder. Then
Pepper heard him fumbling at the fastening of
the trap door. Soon the door came up with a
bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried the stranger. &ldquo;Now,
if you want to help your friend you had better be
quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for opening the trap door!&rdquo;
answered Pepper. He started down the ladder
after the other lad. &ldquo;Will you help me? We&rsquo;ll
pay you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any pay for helping to save a
fellow&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; was the quick response.</p>
<p>It did not take either of the boys long to reach
the yard beside the church. In the rear was a long
shed, where horses were tied up during services.
Pepper knew that the sexton kept a ladder in this
shed and he mentioned the fact to the stranger.
The ladder was found, and both boys ran with it
to the side of the church and started to raise it up
at the spot where Jack was still astride of the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>It was no mean task to raise the long and heavy
ladder. But both Pepper and the stranger realized
that Jack&rsquo;s life hung in the balance and they
worked with a strength born of despair. With a
bang the top of the ladder struck the side of the
church, directly under the young major&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you reach it, Jack?&rdquo; questioned Pepper
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;guess&mdash;so!&rdquo; panted Jack, and let himself
down at arms&rsquo; length on the rope. His feet struck
the top rung of the ladder, and in a few seconds
more he came down to the ground. He staggered
as he struck the grass, and then, lurching into
Pepper&rsquo;s arms, he fainted dead away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">REFF RITTER&rsquo;S CONFESSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He got down just in time,&rdquo; said the strange
boy, as he assisted Pepper in making Jack comfortable
on the grass. &ldquo;Is there a well handy?
If there is I&rsquo;ll get some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a well back of the church,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;But I reckon my chum needs a chance
to get back his wind more than anything else,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>The strange youth ran off, to return presently
with a large tin dipper full of water. With this
he and Pepper bathed the young major&rsquo;s face and
gave him a drink. Jack soon opened his eyes and
sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I&mdash;I fall?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you were on the ground,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You held out just long enough and no longer,&rdquo;
said the strange boy, with a short laugh. &ldquo;You
were plucky to hold out as long as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a terrible experience,&rdquo; answered Jack
soberly. &ldquo;I thought at one time I&rsquo;d surely lose
my grip and break my neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet awhile,&rdquo; advised Pepper.
&ldquo;You need a chance to rest and get back your
nerve, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly had nerve!&rdquo; said the strange
youth, with a grin. &ldquo;But, say, you promised to
tell me what it was all about. I know there is a
military school near here called Putnam Hall?
Do you go there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But&mdash;er&mdash;would
you mind helping me put that ladder back before
we talk? We don&rsquo;t want to be spotted if we can
help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; cried the stranger, and
soon he and The Imp had the ladder down and
back to the shed. By this time Jack had recovered
sufficiently to stand up. He was still a
bit dizzy but his strength was coming back fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Pepper Ditmore,&rdquo; said that youth to the
stranger. &ldquo;And this is my chum, Jack Ruddy.
I am only a private at the Hall but Jack is an
officer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Bert Field,&rdquo; said the stranger, and
extended his hand, which both of the other boys
shook. &ldquo;I am just stopping in Cedarville for a
day or two on business which&mdash;er&mdash;but that won&rsquo;t
interest you,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;It was a lark, eh,
climbing into the belfry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we intended to take away the bell clapper,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. &ldquo;Some of the other
cadets dared us to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get locked in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think one of the other cadets&mdash;who is
down on us&mdash;followed us and fastened the trap
door. I suppose he thinks we are up there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank you for what you did for me,
Field,&rdquo; said Jack, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll&mdash;er&mdash;accept a gift, I&rsquo;ll be
pleased&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you just the same, Ruddy. I don&rsquo;t
want a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d like to do something for you&mdash;to
show you we appreciate your coming to our assistance,&rdquo;
put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d like to visit our school?&rdquo; suggested
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I haven&rsquo;t time just now. But tell
me, do you know a man living in these parts
named Jabez Trask?&rdquo; went on Bert Field,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack, and Pepper shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad! I thought maybe you boys knew
about everybody living in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it somebody you want to find?&rdquo; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;er&mdash;well, never mind. Don&rsquo;t you
bother your head about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The postmaster might be able to tell you
where this Jabez Trask lives,&rdquo; said the young
major. &ldquo;Why not ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to ask too many
questions in public,&rdquo; stammered Bert Field.
&ldquo;You see I&mdash;that is&mdash;can I trust you with my
secret? You&rsquo;ve trusted me with yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; came from both of the Putnam
Hall cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I want to find this Jabez Trask
without his knowing anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pepper,
for he scented a mystery connected with the youth
with whom he and his chum had just become acquainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it&mdash;or at least I don&rsquo;t wish to,
now,&rdquo; answered Bert Field, quickly. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t say anything about it to anybody.&rdquo; He
pulled a silver watch from his pocket. &ldquo;Phew!
after ten o&rsquo;clock! I&rsquo;ll have to be going! Goodbye!
Maybe we&rsquo;ll meet again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged!&rdquo; added Jack. And then the
tall, thin boy turned out of the churchyard and
hurried along the country road, some bushes and
trees soon hiding him from view. The young
major gazed after him curiously and so did
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange fellow,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;But he certainly did us a good turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure did,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Wonder
what he wants of this Jabez Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something important, you may be certain of
that, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be so secret about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets walked to the roadway and then
both stopped short and looked at each other. The
same thought had occurred to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came for that clapper and we might as
well have it,&rdquo; declared Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and
get it, Jack. You can rest behind the bushes,
where nobody will see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll watch out,&mdash;that nobody
comes up to fasten that trap door again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove! that&rsquo;s so! Maybe the Ritter crowd
is hanging around yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are, it was mighty mean of them not
to come to my assistance when I was in peril of
my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they were too scared and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Jack found a convenient spot behind some
bushes and Pepper disappeared once more inside
the church. In less than ten minutes The Imp
reappeared with both the bell clapper and the
battered lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shoved the broken glass into a corner with
my foot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I pulled the rope back
into the belfry. The lower end came loose easily
when I pulled it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;A knot was
caught in a crotch and that is why it held when
the pull was downward. But come on, we&rsquo;d better
be getting back, or we&rsquo;ll have trouble getting into
the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to carry this busted lantern,&rdquo;
said Pepper, and threw the thing behind some
bushes. Then, with the clapper of the bell done
up in a newspaper he had brought along, he struck
out for Putnam Hall, with Jack beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a big row when they find the
clapper gone, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; mused the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll lay it to the Pornell fellows,&rdquo;
answered Pepper, with a broad grin. &ldquo;Hope they
do! It will pay back Roy Bock and his crowd
for their meanness to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Jack had now fully recovered his strength and
both boys kept up a rapid gait until more than
half the distance to Putnam Hall had been
covered. Then, of a sudden, the young major
called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; demanded his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is coming! Maybe some of the
teachers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the cadets leaped from the roadway to
some convenient bushes. It was after hours and
they well knew that to be caught by Captain
Putnam or any of his assistants would mean
severe punishment. Jack might even be reduced
to the ranks, something that would have hurt the
major&rsquo;s feelings exceedingly.</p>
<p>A whistle arose on the air, a peculiar whistle,
thrice repeated. Pepper answered it at once, and
he and Jack stepped back to the roadway. In a
moment they were confronted by Andy Snow and
Stuffer Singleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo; demanded Andy, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kept you so long?&rdquo; added Stuffer. &ldquo;We
made up our minds something had gone wrong and
we were coming to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something did go wrong,&rdquo; burst out Pepper.
&ldquo;Somebody locked us in the belfry.&rdquo; And then
he and his chum told their story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Ritter and his crowd,&rdquo;
declared Stuffer. &ldquo;None of us did it. I was with
Dale and the others all the time, and Andy was
on his errand for Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was certain it was Ritter I&rsquo;d give him a
piece of my mind!&rdquo; declared Jack. &ldquo;It was a
mean piece of business on his part&mdash;after what I
did for him a few weeks ago. He might have been
expelled from this school if I had not asked the
captain to give him another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t rely on Ritter,&rdquo; came from the
cadet who loved to eat. &ldquo;Why, yesterday, I had
an extra piece of pie hidden in a closet, to eat after
lessons, and he came along and gobbled it down!
He ought to have the daylights hammered out of
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got the clapper anyway,&rdquo; said
Pepper, grimly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s up to you, Stuffer, to
treat to that ice-cream, and for Dale to find that
apple pie that was promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise the first time we go to
town, never fear,&rdquo; answered Stuffer. &ldquo;But just
now I think the best thing all of us can do is to
sneak into the school and get to bed, before we
are found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before Ritter plays some more of his
dirty tricks,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>The four cadets walked in the direction of the
school, but before arriving at the campus turned
into a side road bordering the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use of going in by the regular entrance,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be sure to be spotted&mdash;especially
if Ritter or his cronies have told one of the teachers
that we are out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where Snuggers keeps his key to the
kitchen door,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Maybe I can get
that.&rdquo; He referred to Peleg Snuggers, a general
utility man around Putnam Hall, who divided
his time between the school building and the
stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the key?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a nail in the washshed. I saw him put it
there one evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we had better go in by the back way&mdash;if
we can get the key,&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>With caution the boys skirted the edge of the
lake. As they passed the boathouse they heard a
murmur of voices. They were about to set off on
a run, thinking some teachers were in the building,
when Jack called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Reff Ritter talking!&rdquo; he cried, in a low
voice, and a few seconds later there issued from
the boathouse the forms of the school bully and
his two particular cronies, Gus Coulter and Nick
Paxton. As soon as the three saw the other cadets
they started to walk away rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Ritter! I want to talk to you!&rdquo;
cried Jack, in a low but steady tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; snapped back Reff
Ritter, coming to a halt and wheeling around.
It was after hours, so he did not take the trouble
to salute the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you,&mdash;and I want to talk to
Coulter and Paxton, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; and now the seven students
came together close to the side of the boathouse.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me any of your long-winded speeches,
Ruddy, for I am sleepy and want to get to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, you and your gang played a mean trick
on me and Ditmore to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we?&rdquo; sneered the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you think you weren&rsquo;t seen near the
church?&rdquo; put in Pepper, meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who&mdash;er&mdash;who saw us?&rdquo; faltered Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, so you admit you were at the church!&rdquo;
cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, can&rsquo;t you hold your jaw?&rdquo; demanded
Reff Ritter, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, answer me straight,&rdquo; said Jack, in a
determined voice. &ldquo;Were you at the church to-night
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you want to know so badly, I
was,&rdquo; answered the bully. &ldquo;Now then, what of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fastened the trap door of the belfry, did
you?&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">PUNISHING A BULLY</span></h2>
<p>After the frank confession of the bully of
Putnam Hall that he had fastened the trap door
of the church belfry, there was a moment of intense
silence. He faced Jack and Pepper with a
sickly grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a joke on you all right enough,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;You were lucky to get away as
quickly as you did. What did you do,&mdash;force the
trap door open in spite of the bolt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, I think you are about the worst boy
that ever came to this school,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t preach to me, Ditmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say so much if you had played that
trick on me alone,&rdquo; went on The Imp calmly.
&ldquo;But to play it on Jack&mdash;after all he did to save
you from being expelled&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s beyond me.
I guess you don&rsquo;t know what a conscience is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to talk to me like that I&rsquo;ll
smash you one in the jaw!&rdquo; fired back the bully.
&ldquo;I know what I am doing, and it&rsquo;s not for you
to teach me manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that Jack came close to losing
his life at the church and all because you locked
us in the belfry?&rdquo; added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! What are you trying to do, scare
me? It didn&rsquo;t hurt you to be locked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, you listen to me,&rdquo; broke in the young
major, and now his voice was so cold and uncompromising
that all in the crowd held their breath.
&ldquo;You admit that you locked us in the belfry, don&rsquo;t
you? You know what it would have meant for me
if I had been caught there, and you know what it
would have meant for the school. It was mean,
dirt mean. I thought you were going to turn over
a new leaf&mdash;be like the rest of the fellows. Now&mdash;well,
I think I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, a lesson?&rdquo; faltered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I made a mistake when I didn&rsquo;t let
Captain Putnam expel you. The whole school
would have been better off for it. Take off your
jacket and cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am going to give you a sound
thrashing&mdash;and do it before we go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Want to fight, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t say anything about a fight, I said
I was going to give you a sound thrashing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you fight we&rsquo;ll all be caught!&rdquo; cried Nick
Paxton, in alarm. &ldquo;Put it off till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us get to bed!&rdquo; added Coulter. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t say a word about your being at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet you won&rsquo;t&mdash;not unless you want a big
licking,&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word on this, remember that, everybody,&rdquo;
cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember it&mdash;or take the consequences,&rdquo; came
from Stuffer.</p>
<p>While the others were talking Jack had shed
his cadet jacket and his cap and thrown them on
a nearby bench. He faced Ritter so determinedly
that the bully backed away several steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready, if you are going to,&rdquo; returned the
young major. And then as Ritter put up his fists
and stuck out his chin he leaped forward and
caught the bully by one wrist. The grip was like
that of steel and he whirled the fellow around
bodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that!&rdquo; roared Ritter and struck out
wildly. Jack dodged the blow with ease.</p>
<p>Then, with the quickness of lightning, the
young major &ldquo;sailed into&rdquo; his opponent. He hit
Ritter a sharp blow in the right cheek and followed
this up by one on the nose. Then the pair
clinched, and he got the bully&rsquo;s head under his
arm and poked Ritter a hard one in the eye and a
heavy one in the mouth that loosened several teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Le&mdash;let me g&mdash;g&mdash;go!&rdquo; spluttered the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you go when I am done with you!&rdquo;
returned Jack. &ldquo;I am going to teach you a lesson
you won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break away!&rdquo; cried Gus Coulter. &ldquo;Fight him
fair, Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a fight&mdash;I am merely giving him the
thrashing he deserves,&rdquo; answered the young
major. &ldquo;You keep out of it&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll serve you
the same,&rdquo; he added, so sharply that Coulter
stepped back in alarm.</p>
<p>How badly Jack might have damaged Ritter
it is hard to state. He was thoroughly aroused
and anxious to give the bully a &ldquo;dressing down&rdquo;
he should never forget. But in the midst of the
excitement a cry of alarm arose from Paxton,
who had been looking anxiously towards the
school building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese it!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Somebody is
coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Crabtree!&rdquo; exclaimed Stuffer. &ldquo;Boys,
we have got to leg it, unless we want to get
caught,&rdquo; he added, as the tall and angular form
of the teacher was seen to emerge from the school
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Jack had no more desire to be caught than anybody
else and he quickly relinquished his hold on
the bully and picked up his jacket and cap.
Ritter was so dazed that he staggered for a
second when let alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&mdash;you just wait, Jack Ruddy!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Just wait! I&rsquo;ll get even, if it takes a
lifetime to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish the thrashing some other time,
Ritter,&rdquo; answered the young officer, and then he
and his chums ran in one direction while the bully
and his cronies ran in another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; came in the harsh, dictatorial
voice of Josiah Crabtree, and he came rushing
over the campus, cane in hand. &ldquo;Stop, whoever
you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately for the cadets the moon, which
had been shining clearly, now went under a heavy
cloud, leaving the campus in darkness. The gloom
was disastrous for the teacher, for in his hurry he
did not see a low bench bordering the path. He
bumped into the bench heavily, lost his balance,
and went sprawling on his chest and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! who did this? Who upset me?&rdquo; he
screamed wrathfully. &ldquo;Stop, you young rascals!
If you don&rsquo;t stop I&rsquo;ll have you all expelled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He picked himself up after an effort and got
back his wind, but by that time all of the cadets
were out of sight. The Ritter contingent went
to an angle of the school building, where hung a
rope running up to a dormitory. Jack, Pepper and
Stuffer followed Andy to the washshed and there
secured the key left by Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Andy,&rdquo; cried Pepper, who was
looking back to see if they were being followed.
&ldquo;Remember, old Crabtree is on the warpath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitchen door was quickly opened, the key
being left in the lock, and up a back stairs sped
the four cadets, Pepper leading the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; whispered The Imp, when
the upper hallway was gained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; questioned Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the bell clapper. Crabtree is out of
his room, and we might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! just the thing!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Give
it to me, Pep. You have done enough for one
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with Andy,&rdquo; put in Stuffer. &ldquo;You and
Jack go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while the young major and his chum sped
for their dormitory Andy and Stuffer ran down a
side hall leading to the apartment occupied by
Josiah Crabtree. As expected, the door was unlocked
and they quickly stepped inside the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it in his bureau drawer, among his
shirts,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be sure to find it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; cried the lad who
loved to eat. &ldquo;But it will rob me of my candy,&rdquo;
he added woefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the idea, Stuffer?&rdquo; asked Andy, who
was placing the bell clapper between the teacher&rsquo;s
dress shirts in the bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this molasses candy with me. Supposing
I put some of it in the bed? He
might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have sweet dreams!&rdquo; finished the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;Good! Spread the candy out well,
Stuffer. It&rsquo;s a bit hard, I know. But the heat
of old Crabtree&rsquo;s body will fix it all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell clapper disposed of, the two cadets
spread the molasses candy, which was in thin, flat
form, in the bed, between the sheets. Then they
turned down the light as they had found it, and
hurried forth and to their quarters. As they did
this they heard a door below slammed shut and
locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree is coming in!&rdquo; announced Pepper,
who was on the watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager he is as mad
as a hornet for not catching us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the other cadets had been told about
what was going on, and at several dormitory doors
heads peeped forth. But then sounded a peculiar
whistle, coming from Emerald Hogan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>It was a signal that the teacher was coming
around, inspecting the dormitories. Every cadet
understood, and there was a wild scramble to put
out the lights and leap into bed.</p>
<p>The only lad who did not escape was Gus Coulter.
In the semi-darkness he ran into another
cadet and was knocked flat. Before he could get
up and reach his bed the door opened and Josiah
Crabtree appeared. The light was burning
brightly, for it was Coulter&rsquo;s duty that week to
put it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, stand up!&rdquo; cried the teacher, wrathfully,
and the cadet arose sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing out of bed this time of
night?&rdquo; demanded Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I got up to&mdash;er&mdash;to get a drink,&rdquo;
answered the youth, stammeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; was the sarcastic rejoinder. &ldquo;And
do you dress every time you want a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this question there was a snicker from one
of the beds. Josiah Crabtree whirled around to
find out who was laughing at him. But every
boy lay as if sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was laughing, I demand to know!&rdquo; cried
the teacher.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, were you outside a few minutes ago?&rdquo;
went on Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked the cadet, in apparent astonishment.
&ldquo;I just got out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And dressed to get a drink of water, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t feel well and I thought
I might need a doctor. But I am better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! a likely story,&rdquo; growled the teacher.
&ldquo;I will attend to your case later.&rdquo; And off he
hurried, to find out, if possible, if any students
in the other dormitories were up.</p>
<p>When he reached the room used by Jack and
his friends he found the young major on his back
snoring lustily. All the other boys seemed to be
sleeping soundly, and their garments were hung
up with care and their shoes placed exactly as the
regulations of the school required. The teacher
did not know that under the covers some of the
boys had not yet taken off their socks and dress
shirts, and that the shoes at Pepper&rsquo;s chair were
an extra pair and not the ones The Imp had been
wearing all day,&mdash;those foot coverings being still
on his feet.</p>
<p>Having looked around carefully, Josiah Crabtree
retired and continued his inspection of the
sleeping rooms. As soon as he was out of sight
and hearing Pepper sat up and so did his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just escaped and no more,&rdquo; said Dale Blackmore.
&ldquo;Well, a miss is as good as four miles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; somebody would have been caught
had he looked at Pep&rsquo;s feet!&rdquo; came from Emerald.
&ldquo;Nixt toime take off your shoes, me b&rsquo;y, &rsquo;tis
safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
take them off now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Walking around
the Hall at night in my socks is good enough for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had been told of what had been done
with the sticky candy, and all waited impatiently
for Josiah Crabtree to retire. Presently they
heard the teacher enter his room, closing and locking
the door after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a little more fun!&rdquo; whispered The
Imp. &ldquo;Come on, but don&rsquo;t make any noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after another the cadets stole out in the
dimly-lit hallway and tiptoed their way to the
teacher&rsquo;s apartment. Listening at the door they
heard Josiah Crabtree disrobe, put out the light,
and crawl into bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just wait!&rdquo; whispered Stuffer. &ldquo;There
will be something doing in a few minutes, mark
my words!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">JOSIAH CRABTREE MAKES A FIND</span></h2>
<p>With bated breaths the cadets awaited developments
in the room occupied by the dictatorial
Josiah Crabtree. They were not long in coming.</p>
<p>They heard the teacher turn over several times
in bed. Then came a few seconds of silence and
then a snort of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this stuff?&rdquo; they heard Josiah Crabtree
mutter. &ldquo;Is it glue, or what? I&rsquo;m stuck full
of it! It must be another trick of those confounded
boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the teacher bounced up out of bed. The
sheets came up with him, and as he started to
move toward the light, so that he might illuminate
the scene, he got tangled up and fell to the floor
with a crash, taking a stand full of books with
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;What is the matter with
me, anyway? I am all tangled up! That must
be glue, and I am full of it! Oh, those boys!&rdquo;
And then the lads heard him roll over and over in
the darkness, trying to get out of the snarl of
sticky bed sheets. Pepper burst out laughing, for
he could hold in no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you young rascal, who are you?&rdquo; roared
the irate teacher. &ldquo;What do you mean by treating
me in such a fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are having a sweet time of it, Professor!&rdquo;
called out Stuffer, in a deep bass voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The candy is yours, for nothing!&rdquo; added
Pepper. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t eat too much, it may give
you indigestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get hold of you!&rdquo; cried Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you expelled from Putnam
Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose to his feet at last and started towards
the door. But by the time he had it open the
cadets had fled and he found the hall deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villains!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Oh, wait till
I catch them! Just wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo; came in a
voice from a side hall, and Captain Putnam appeared,
attired in a dressing gown and slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cadets&mdash;some of them have been playing
tricks on me,&rdquo; spluttered the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! What sort of tricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They put molasses candy in my bed. I am
stuck full of the sticky stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I am going to find out!&rdquo;
was the savage answer. &ldquo;Some of them were out
skylarking to-night and I went after them, but I
didn&rsquo;t catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This skylarking at night must stop,&rdquo; said the
master of the Hall. &ldquo;If you find out who is
guilty, report to me,&rdquo; and he went back to his
room.</p>
<p>Safe in their dormitories, the cadets lost no time
in disrobing and getting to bed. Some of them
expected an immediate inspection, but it did not
come. Josiah Crabtree visited a bathroom, to
clear himself of the sticky candy, and by the time
he had cleaned up it was too late to go after the
boys who had played the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word, all around!&rdquo; said Andy,
after things had quieted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter and his cronies may give us away,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do they had better look out!&rdquo; answered
one of the big students. &ldquo;We want no tale-bearers
in this school. I&rsquo;ll warn them.&rdquo; And,
early in the morning he did so. It was a good
move, for Coulter and Paxton were preparing to
send a note to Captain Putnam, exposing Pepper,
Jack and their chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do anything of the sort and you&rsquo;ll catch
it good and hot!&rdquo; said the big student. &ldquo;Remember,
we haven&rsquo;t forgot how you acted during the
rebellion. If you don&rsquo;t behave yourselves we&rsquo;ll
make it so uncomfortable for you that you&rsquo;ll want
to go home.&rdquo; And then, in fright, Coulter and
Paxton tore the note up.</p>
<p>By noon it was known throughout Cedarville
that the church had been visited and the clapper
of the bell taken. Some folks attributed the trick
to the Pornell students, some to the Putnam Hall
cadets, and still others to some village lads. A
deacon of the church went to Pornell Academy
and demanded the clapper, and got into a warm
row with Doctor Pornell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My students are young gentlemen, they would
not do such a thing!&rdquo; cried the head of the
academy, wrathfully. &ldquo;It is an outrage to accuse
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t any too good to paint the church
porch red,&rdquo; returned the deacon, pointedly. &ldquo;If
they have the clapper I want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this remark Dr. Pornell subsided and made
some inquiries, but, of course, the clapper was
not found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>It was not until evening that Josiah Crabtree
went to his bureau drawer, to get out a clean dress
shirt. He was still in a bad humor over the candy
affair, and he hauled forth a shirt with no gentle
hand.</p>
<p>The next instant he let out a cry of commingled
pain and astonishment for the clapper had rolled
from the shirt and fallen on his toes. He danced
around on one foot, trying to nurse the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another trick!&rdquo; he howled. &ldquo;Oh my toes!
The big one must be smashed to a jelly! And
what is that iron thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nursed his foot for several minutes and then
picked up the clapper and turned it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bell clapper! Ha! is it possible! It must
be! The clapper belonging to the church! I must
inform Captain Putnam of this at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the stairs he hobbled as well as his injured
foot permitted. He found the master of the school
just preparing to take a drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found it, sir!&rdquo; cried the teacher. &ldquo;It
was hidden, where do you suppose? in one of my
bureau drawers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; asked Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell clapper belonging to the Union
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; And now the Captain&rsquo;s face
took on a look of concern, for one of the church
members had asked him about the clapper during
the afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew some of the boys were up to mischief
last night,&rdquo; went on Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;We ought
to find out who is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of this bell clapper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return it to the church at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will you investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning, as soon as the school
session begins,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;Give me the clapper. I&rsquo;ll return it myself.&rdquo;
And the article was placed in his charge and he
drove off with it. He left it at the home of the
church sexton, and it was that evening restored to
its original position in the belfry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for trouble to-morrow,&rdquo; said Pepper,
late that evening, as he came in from a visit to the
school library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of the clapper?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Captain Putnam is going to conduct a
strict investigation to-morrow morning, as soon as
school opens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do if he questions every
cadet?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll face the music,&rdquo; answered Jack promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think he&rsquo;ll do if he finds out you
took the clapper?&rdquo; questioned Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. Cut off our holidays
perhaps,&mdash;or reduce me to the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my holidays cut,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;And to have Jack&rsquo;s official position taken from
him would be too mean for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the boys who had had a part in taking the
clapper and putting it in Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s room
were very much worried although they tried not
to show it. It was one thing to play a joke and
quite another to take the consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Reff Ritter and his crowd will laugh if
we are found out and punished,&rdquo; said Pepper to
his intimate chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they laugh too loud I&rsquo;ll punch &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe what the captain does will depend upon
what the church folks do,&rdquo; put in Joe Nelson. &ldquo;If
they raise a big row he&rsquo;ll have to investigate pretty
thoroughly. It might be a good thing to smooth
matters over with the church people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how would you do that?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you might explain that it was only a bit
of boyish fun, done on a dare&mdash;and you might
propose to give the church an extra donation if
the matter was dropped. I think Deacon Pelham
would drop the matter if the extra donation was
made&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the head man in the church just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deacon Pelham!&rdquo; cried Fred Century. You
mean Isaac Pelham, who lives up the lake shore
near Grape Creek?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I know him well. I took him out in my
boat once,&mdash;when he was in a great hurry to get a
doctor from across the lake. He was very thankful
and wanted to pay me for my services, but I
told him I wasn&rsquo;t running the <i>Ajax</i> for money.
That was when I was a student at Pornell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are the one to go to Deacon Pelham
and smooth matters over,&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;Go ahead,
Fred; it may aid Pep and Jack a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred needn&rsquo;t to do it unless he feels like it,&rdquo;
said the young major of the Hall battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; came from Dale. &ldquo;Fred
needn&rsquo;t to mention any names, only state that some
of the boys would like to hush the matter up and
also want to make a contribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and presently it
was decided that Fred should pay the deacon a
visit, accompanied by Dale. They carried with
them a &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; amounting to six dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go on bicycles,&rdquo; suggested Dale,
and got out his machine. Fred used a machine
belonging to Pepper, and as the road was good the
distance to Deacon Pelham&rsquo;s home was quickly
covered. They found the deacon coming in from
a day of labor in a distant field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Deacon Pelham,&rdquo; said Fred
politely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my soul, it&rsquo;s Fred Century!&rdquo;
cried the deacon smiling. &ldquo;How do you do!&rdquo;
And he held out his hand. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this with you,
another young sodger, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, my fellow cadet, Dale Blackmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house. My wife will be glad to
see you&mdash;she&rsquo;s much better than when I had to
hurry for a doctor that time,&rdquo; added the church
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t much time to spare, Mr. Pelham,&rdquo;
said Fred. He lowered his voice. &ldquo;We came on
a little business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You once said if you could do me a favor you
would,&rdquo; continued the owner of the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see you about that bell clapper
that was brought back to the church this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Deacon Pelham&rsquo;s face became a study.
&ldquo;Did you take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it. It was a scandalous piece of
business. But what do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that some of the cadets of Putnam
Hall wish to hush the matter up. It was only a
little joke and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very bad joke, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but they thought that if you&rsquo;d drop
it they would make the church a contribution of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred drew out the money&mdash;six new crisp one-dollar
bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! Six dollars, eh? Well&mdash;er&mdash;the
church needs money that is sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will pay for the cut rope and more, sir. It
was only a joke. If you&rsquo;ll drop it, it will save
some cadets a lot of trouble,&rdquo; went on Fred earnestly.
&ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to send word to
Captain Putnam that the matter has been adjusted.
You&rsquo;ll do that for me, won&rsquo;t you Mr.
Pelham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the deacon was obdurate, but in the
end he weakened. The church was in a poor way
and needed every dollar it could get. As head of
the committee he promised to drop the matter,
and wrote a note to that effect and signed it. Then
Fred gave him the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mind you, no more jokes,&rdquo; said the
deacon, as the cadets departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that kind anyway,&rdquo; answered Fred, and
off he sped on his bicycle, with Dale beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easier than I thought,&rdquo; said Dale.
&ldquo;Now to get that note to Captain Putnam in
secret before he starts his investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF IMPORTANCE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that note will do the business&mdash;and
we&rsquo;ll never be suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Reff Ritter who spoke and he addressed
Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton. The three cronies
were in a wing of the school, out of sight and
hearing of the other pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you put in the note?&rdquo; asked Paxton
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wrote in a disguised hand and stated
that I knew the cadets had banded together to
keep mum about the bell clapper and the only way
for Captain Putnam to get at the bottom of the
affair was to ask each officer and private, starting
from the major down. I put the note on the captain&rsquo;s
desk and he must have it by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; chuckled Paxton. &ldquo;If he starts in by
questioning Ruddy he&rsquo;ll soon get at the bottom of
the matter, for the major won&rsquo;t dare to tell a falsehood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;And more than likely he&rsquo;ll lose his position,&rdquo;
put in Coulter. &ldquo;I hope he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to lose it,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter.
Not for a moment did he give Jack credit for the
good turn he had done him.</p>
<p>While the three lads were talking Captain Putnam
had entered his office and taken up the note.
He read it with interest and his brow contracted.</p>
<p>He was much disturbed, for since the open rebellion
of the cadets, when they had refused to
be starved into submission by Pluxton Cuddle,
he had made the students promise not to band
together in secret against the discipline of the
school. Ritter knew this, and this was why he
sent the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot permit this,&rdquo; murmured the head of
the school to himself. &ldquo;I must make a complete
investigation to-morrow,&mdash;and the guilty parties
must be made to suffer.&rdquo; And then he held a
conference with Josiah Crabtree and George
Strong. Crabtree was in favor of punishing
nearly everybody, but George Strong, with his
usual goodheartedness, counseled moderation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;It most likely was merely a thoughtless
prank,&rdquo; said Mr. Strong. &ldquo;The cadets meant no
harm. Bell clappers, as you know, have been
taken by students from times immemorial.&rdquo; And
at this Captain Putnam had to turn away with a
smile, for in his younger days he himself had
assisted at the removal of, not a clapper, but the
bell of the boarding school he had attended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see in the morning,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
and there for the time being the matter
rested.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Jack, Pepper and
their chums were somewhat worried that night,
and the young major slept but little. Fred and
Dale had reported the interview with Deacon
Pelham and had seen to it that the note got into
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Early in the morning Pepper was out on the
campus when he saw Captain Putnam appear.
A moment later one of the stablemen brought up
the captain&rsquo;s black horse and the head of the Hall
vaulted into the saddle in true military style and
was off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a hurry,&rdquo; thought Pepper, and he
wondered where the master of the school was
going. He watched the captain turn into the lake
road and then uttered a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a button he is going to visit Deacon
Pelham!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Maybe he wants to
learn if that note was genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The roll of the drum soon summoned all of the
cadets to the campus, and with Jack at the head
of the battalion, they went through the manual of
arms and then marched around the Hall and into
the messroom. Jack and Pepper both put on a
bold front, yet each felt far from easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll catch it&mdash;just wait!&rdquo; whispered Ritter
to Coulter. &ldquo;Before noon they&rsquo;ll wish they had
let that clapper alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast the cadets went to chapel. The
services here were almost over when Captain Putnam
came in and took his place on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll hear something drop!&rdquo; said Ritter
gleefully, to his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, stop your talking!&rdquo; said George Strong,
who was near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I only wanted the window closed,&rdquo;
stammered the bully. &ldquo;I feel cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you close it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter was right there&mdash;I thought he could
do it.&rdquo; Then the window was closed, and the conversation
came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few words to say to you young
gentlemen,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam, coming to the
front of the platform. His eyes swept the auditorium
and Jack and Pepper felt something cold
run up and down their backbones. &ldquo;As you all
know, the clapper of the bell of the Union Church
was taken night before last, and the deed was done
by some cadets of this institution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The captain paused, and the silence was so
intense that the ticking of the clock could be
plainly heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taking of the clapper was a foolish prank,
and it was an equally foolish prank to place it
where it was found,&rdquo; continued Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;Yesterday I resolved to make a thorough investigation
and punish the offenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, eminently proper,&rdquo; murmured
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard, too, that a plan had been put through
by you cadets to stand together&mdash;that everybody
was to keep mum, as it is called. This you know
is a violation of the agreement made after the&mdash;er&mdash;the
unfortunate affair which&mdash;er&mdash;led to a
rebellion among you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear of that,&rdquo; murmured one of the
cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Farhaven?&rdquo; asked the captain
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear of any agreement to keep mum,&rdquo;
replied the cadet addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did I,&rdquo; put in Bob Grenwood, the
quartermaster of the battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; came from several others.</p>
<p>At these words the captain&rsquo;s face showed relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;All who have not agreed to band together will
raise their hands,&rdquo; said the captain loudly, and
instantly nearly every cadet raised his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really gratifying,&rdquo; went on Captain
Putnam, with almost a smile on his face. &ldquo;To
my mind, to take the clapper was bad enough, but
to band together to overthrow the discipline of the
school would be much worse. I am glad to learn
you young gentlemen have not done such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the head of the school paused, and the
boys wondered what was coming next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to return to the clapper. I have received
a communication from one of the officers of the
church and he had made an earnest request that
the whole matter be dropped. The church has the
clapper back, and the ones who took it have expressed
their regrets over the affair, and have
made the church a donation which had been gratefully
received. Under the circumstances, I am
going to leave this matter in the hands of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he means by that?&rdquo; murmured
Dale to Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor of dropping the matter will rise.
Those wishing to see the culprits punished will
remain seated,&rdquo; went on Captain Putnam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Almost instantly three-quarters of the cadets
arose to their feet. More followed, until but half
a dozen remained seated. These were Reff Ritter,
Coulter, Paxton, and their cohorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, you fellows!&rdquo; cried Bart Conners,
captain of Company B. And somewhat shamefacedly
Ritter and the others got up. The bully
realized that his plan to have Jack and Pepper
punished had fallen through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Captain Putnam!&rdquo; cried Dale
and before the head of the school could interfere,
the cheers were given with a will. Then came a
cheer for the teachers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager old Crabtree doesn&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo;
whispered Andy to Joe Nelson, and he was right.
Josiah Crabtree felt very much put out, for he
had expected to see somebody punished, not only
for putting the clapper in his bureau drawer but
also for placing the molasses candy in his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another important announcement to
make,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam, after order and
quietness had been restored. &ldquo;As you know, we
were to go on the term encampment two weeks
from to-day. I have arranged to have some alterations
made to this school by carpenters and
masons, and they wish to start the work next week.
Consequently, I am going to start the encampment
next Tuesday&mdash;that is, we&rsquo;ll leave the Hall on that
day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came from the cadets, for they
looked forward to the encampment with much
pleasure. During that time there would be no
studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have arranged for an outing up at Lake
Caboy,&rdquo; continued Captain Putnam. &ldquo;The spot
will be not far from the Caboy River with its
magnificent falls, and will be ideal in every respect.
I camped there once some years ago, and
I know the fishing is good and also the swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo; cried Pepper. He was much
relieved to think the clapper affair had been
dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hired a tract of land over a hundred
acres in extent,&rdquo; went on Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go out as we did before, taking all our
tents and our camping outfit with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long will the encampment last?&rdquo;
asked Jack. He was as much relieved as Pepper
over the outcome of the clapper affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least two weeks, Major Ruddy, and perhaps
longer&mdash;if the carpenters and masons do not finish
up here in time. I do not want the students to
come back here until the alterations are complete.
To-morrow I shall announce more of the details.
The students will now go to their classes as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>As the boys poured forth from the chapel exercises
Jack and Pepper worked their way over to
Dale and Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your visit to Deacon Pelham did the trick,&rdquo;
whispered the young major. &ldquo;I am a thousand
times obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added The Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know about this banding together
the captain mentioned,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;I never
heard of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can put you wise,&rdquo; came from Bob
Grenwood, who was near. &ldquo;I overheard Ritter
and Coulter talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be like Ritter to get up that report!&rdquo;
cried Pepper. &ldquo;He would do anything to get our
crowd into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Grenwood, who had once suffered
greatly at the hands of the bully, as I have
related in detail in &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to watch Ritter as closely as we
ever did,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;The trouble he got into
a few weeks ago doesn&rsquo;t seem to have made him
a bit better than he was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ordinarily the clapper incident would have
been the main topic of conversation among the
cadets. But the announcement that the term encampment
was to start in the near future turned
the thoughts of the students in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the time of our lives,&rdquo; declared
Andy. &ldquo;Just think of the fine swimming and
fishing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no lessons!&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the baseball and track athletics!&rdquo; said
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were going to say the eating,&rdquo;
came slyly from Pepper. &ldquo;When we talk about
going camping you usually talk grub the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, I expect to have plenty to eat,&rdquo;
added Stuffer hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one thing will happen during the encampment,&rdquo;
said one of the other cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be more or less hazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to haze Ritter &amp; Company,&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;They richly deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Ritter &amp; Company will try to haze us,&rdquo;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let them try it,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we can give them as good as they send,
every time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">WHAT THE GIRLS HAD TO TELL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Jack, to a spin on our
wheels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me, Pepper. Shall we go alone,
or ask some of the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already asked Andy and Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after school hours and still light. As
the cadets had good bicycles they often took rides
up and down the lake road, or out in the country
back of Cedarville.</p>
<p>All of the cadets were soon ready for the spin,
and off they went, Jack and Pepper abreast, with
Andy and Dale close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a race?&rdquo; asked Andy. &ldquo;I feel as if I
could ride like the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go you!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stripped for racing, but I&rsquo;ll join in
for the fun of it,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; added the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Coming to a smooth portion of the road the four
bicycle riders drew up abreast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is this race to be?&rdquo; questioned Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, to Boston and back,&rdquo; cried Pepper, with
a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it Hong Kong while you are at it,&rdquo;
added Jack gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll race to the old white post,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mile and a half from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off shot the four cadets, keeping abreast for a
distant of several rods. Then Andy pedalled to
the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where I bid you good-bye!&rdquo; sang out
the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered Pepper, and
commenced to push on his pedals harder than ever.
He soon ranged alongside of Andy, and away they
went, side by side, with Dale and Jack dropping
further and further behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make time in this uniform,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;Let them race it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;I hate to
get in a perspiration right before supper anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>On and on went Andy and Pepper. The road
was in excellent condition and so were the cadets.
Each lad rode well and it remained a question as
to who would come in ahead.</p>
<p>Half the distance to the post had been covered
when the racers reached a turn. Around this
they sped, and as they did so an unexpected
scream reached their ears. It came from two girls
in a buggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run us down!&rdquo; came the cry. And then
the cadets saw that the girls had been in the act
of turning their buggy around and that the turnout
completely filled the road.</p>
<p>There was but one thing to do and that was to
turn aside. Andy went to the right and Pepper
to the left, and each brought up rather suddenly
in a clump of bushes. Andy flew over his handle
bars, and it was only his acrobatic agility that
saved him from being seriously hurt.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">There was but one thing to do, and that was to turn aside.</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>Both of the girls screamed again, this time
louder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are killed!&rdquo; moaned one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo; came from the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our fault, Flossie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Laura!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Their horse, greatly startled by the sudden appearance
of the bicyclists, had begun to rear and
plunge and for the moment the girls had to give
all their attention to the animal in an effort to
quiet it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Pepper Ditmore!&rdquo; cried the older
girl, as The Imp arose to his feet from the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Andy Snow,&rdquo; added the other girl.</p>
<p>Still somewhat dazed the cadets looked again
at the girls and now recognized two old acquaintances,
Laura and Flossie Ford. They were the
daughters of Rossmore Ford, a rich gentleman
who had a fine summer home on a point of the lake
shore. As related in &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo;
Andy, Jack and Pepper had once saved Laura
and Flossie from drowning, and for this brave act
the Fords were extremely grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, girls!&rdquo; cried Pepper, with a
grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pepper are you hurt?&rdquo; queried Laura
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, scratched a little, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of you, Andy?&rdquo; questioned Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a few bush leaves down my neck, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; answered Andy. His wrist was a good deal
scratched but he kept it out of sight, not wishing
to alarm the girls still more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do anything for you?&rdquo; questioned
Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might bake us a few pies,&mdash;as you did when
we ran away from school,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; cried Flossie, and gave a laugh.
&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad you didn&rsquo;t hurt yourselves
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Jack and Dale were coming up,
and the situation was quickly explained. The
young major shook hands with the girls and turned
the horse around for them. The Ford girls were
glad to meet the cadets but sorry that they had
interrupted the race so disastrously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was a tie anyway,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care, if Pep doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much of a race anyway,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;How have you been since we saw you
last?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Laura. &ldquo;How are
matters at the school? We heard somebody had
taken the clapper of the Union Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we heard, too,&rdquo; said Dale dryly. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s a thing of the past now. We are getting
ready to go into camp again&mdash;this time in the
regular fashion, under Captain Putnam and the
teachers, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; murmured Flossie. &ldquo;And
where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to Lake Caboy, near the river and the
falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so surprised?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we are going up to Lake Caboy ourselves&mdash;up
to the new summer hotel there. Papa
and mamma thought it would be a change for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may see something of each other,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;That will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come down to your camp&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll
allow visitors,&rdquo; said Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Captain Putnam will have to allow
them. Every time we go into camp the country
folks come to see us. They like to see the tents
and the uniforms, and like to see us drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be sure to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to arrange for a regular visitors&rsquo;
day,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;Then we can have
drills and athletic contests, and a lunch, and all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be grand!&rdquo; cried both girls
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been to Lake Caboy before?&rdquo;
questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were up there two years ago, for a
week,&rdquo; answered Laura. &ldquo;We stayed at the old
hotel that was burnt down&mdash;a place near the old
Robertson mill. You&rsquo;ve heard of that place,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said to be haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted!&rdquo; cried all of the cadets in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We never went very near it, for we
were afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to investigate that mill,&rdquo; said Dale.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had almost forgotten about the old mill
until yesterday,&rdquo; went on Flossie. &ldquo;Then the
strangest kind of a boy asked us about it&mdash;a tall,
thin boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall, thin boy!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Did he tell
you his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bert Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we met that boy once,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t looking for the Robertson mill
then. He was looking for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And then
Pepper stopped short, for he remembered what
the strange lad had said&mdash;that he wished to find
Jabez Trask without that individual being aware
he was being sought out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he looking for?&rdquo; asked Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did ask us about something else,&rdquo; said
Flossie. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now. He wanted
to know where a man named Trask lived&mdash;Jabez
Trask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he asked us, too,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Did
you tell him? We never heard of such a person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we told him. Trask lives between here
and Lake Caboy, on the Ritchfield road. We
know because papa once had some business dealings
with him. He is an old man, and papa says
he is a regular miser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the boy a relative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he was certainly a strange
fellow. He asked us a great number of questions
and seemed to be grateful for the information we
gave him. But this morning papa took me across
the lake in his boat and when I was in the town
over there I met him again, face to face, and he
didn&rsquo;t even recognize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer,&rdquo; said Jack thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Maybe he was afraid you&rsquo;d say something in
public he didn&rsquo;t want you to. He told us he
didn&rsquo;t want this Jabez Trask to know he was
asking for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told papa about it, and he told me something
that makes the matter queerer than ever.
He says that the Trask family once had something
to do with the old Robertson mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; mused Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet
that boy again and talk to him. Maybe he knows
something about why the old mill is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly a strange boy!&rdquo; declared
Laura.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The girls wished to know something of the
details of the proposed encampment and the
cadets told as much as they knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come over if we can,&rdquo; promised Laura.
&ldquo;And if you get the chance you must call on us
at the new hotel.&rdquo; And this the cadets readily
promised to do. Then the girls turned homeward,
and the boys continued their ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fine girls,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;It was a
great feather in your cap to save them from
drowning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us forget that!&rdquo; cried Andy, who did
not care at any time to pose as a hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I regret about this encampment
at Lake Caboy,&rdquo; said Jack, as the four
cadets turned in the direction of Putnam Hall.
&ldquo;There is no way of getting our sailboats up to
that lake. Some of the rowboats will be taken
over on the wagons, but I&rsquo;ll have to leave the
<i>Alice</i> behind, and Fred Century will have to
leave the <i>Ajax</i>, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to take our fun on the water
out in rowing and swimming and fishing,&rdquo; said
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with having a nice sail
before we go away?&rdquo; came from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, we can do that,&rdquo; said Jack; and
so, later on, it was arranged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The <i>Alice</i> was a truly beautiful sloop, with
graceful lines. Her hull was finely painted and
her sails were of snowy whiteness. The <i>Ajax</i>, too,
was a good boat, and the youthful owners were
justly proud of the two craft.</p>
<p>On the Saturday afternoon previous to the time
for the encampment Jack and Fred made up their
parties for a sail. The young major carried
Pepper, Andy and four others, and the <i>Ajax</i> took
on an even greater load. It was decided to go up
the lake, and the cadets received permission to
remain out from two o&rsquo;clock to six.</p>
<p>There was a favorable wind blowing, and a
cheer went up when the two sloops spread their
canvases and stood up the lake shore. Jack and
Fred were at the tillers and each handled his craft
with care and skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to race?&rdquo; asked one of the cadets, of
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are just out for the pleasure of it,&rdquo;
said Fred. He knew his boat was a good one, but
the young major had beaten him before and he
did not, just then, wish to risk another defeat.</p>
<p>Soon the sloops were well on their way up the
lake. Pepper and Andy were in particularly good
humor, and neither of them dreamed of the remarkable
adventure in store for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A REMARKABLE ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark came from Andy, who was in the
bow of the boat. He was gazing anxiously at the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say rain!&rdquo; cried Stuffer, who was eating
a banana, one of a hand purchased at the Cedarville
dock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be out in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not get it right away,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;But it looks as if it would come sooner or later,&rdquo;
he added, as he surveyed the clouds over to the
westward.</p>
<p>Two hours had been spent in cruising around
the lake. A brief stop had been made at Cedarville,
where the cadets had purchased some fruit
and candy. The <i>Ajax</i> was almost out of sight in
the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going near Parberry Point I&rsquo;d like
to do an errand,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I want to visit
that old basket maker and ask him to make a fancy
basket for my Aunt Bess. She has a birthday
soon, and I know she would like a new hanging
basket, with ferns and flowers in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we can pass there,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop you and then pick you up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Anybody
want to go to the basket maker&rsquo;s with me?&rdquo; he
went on, looking around at his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eating so
much fruit and candy I think it will do me good
to walk a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The errand won&rsquo;t take more than half an
hour,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hurry as fast as we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parberry Point was soon reached and Andy and
Pepper leaped ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back here in just half an hour,&rdquo; cried
Jack, consulting his watch. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us waiting,
for maybe that rain will come quicker than I
thought it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry all I can,&rdquo; answered The Imp.
&ldquo;Come on, Andy.&rdquo; And the pair disappeared up
the road from the lake, while the sloop sheered off
for the other shore.</p>
<p>Pepper and Andy were both good walkers and
they lost no time in getting to the spot where the
basket maker had lived. To their dismay the
cottage was closed and deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must have moved,&rdquo; said the acrobatic youth.
&ldquo;Too bad! What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Andy. Wait, here comes a man
in a wagon. Maybe he can tell us where the fellow
moved to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer was consulted and said the basket
maker had moved up a side road leading to Lake
Caboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about a quarter of a mile from here,&rdquo;
he explained.</p>
<p>Pepper decided to walk the distance and he and
Andy set off. Just as both cadets made a turn in
the road they heard a distant rumble of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That storm is coming faster than I thought,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, and we&rsquo;ll have to hurry, unless
we want to get wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It won&rsquo;t do any good to get to the
sloop. We&rsquo;ll get wet on her as well as out here,
Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went on, around another bend of the
road, and soon came in sight of a second cottage.
But to their astonishment, this too was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come on a fool&rsquo;s errand,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;The basket maker was here but has moved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>They could see the evidences of basket making
in the dooryard, but the cottage was locked up and
minus furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well get back to the Point,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;Jack will be waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this side road is shorter than the other,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;It makes a turn toward the lake
just above here. We&rsquo;ll keep on instead of turning
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you say so, Pep. But it doesn&rsquo;t
look right to me,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>The pair hurried on, for the sky was now growing
dark. The rumbling of thunder increased, and
presently some large drops of rain came down
through the trees bordering the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well run for it!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and
set off on a dog trot. In a few minutes they made
a turn and came out on a broad highway. Just
beyond was a large white mansion set in a perfect
wilderness of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this isn&rsquo;t the road I was looking for!&rdquo;
cried Pepper in dismay. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we
are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when there came a rush
of wind through the trees. This was followed by
flashes of lightning and cracks of thunder, and
then the rain came down in a torrent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay out here&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be drenched to
the skin!&rdquo; cried the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;Come on to
the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know the folks, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. Any port in a storm, as
the sailors say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy started through the trees for the mansion
and Pepper followed at his heels. Both ran across
a small and badly-kept lawn and up on a broad
piazza. Just as they reached the piazza there came
a blinding flash of lightning and a peal of thunder
that made both jump in fright. Then followed a
crash of another kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck a tree&mdash;out yonder!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper, pointing towards the road. &ldquo;I am glad
we weren&rsquo;t under it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get in the house, where the rain can&rsquo;t
reach us,&rdquo; answered his chum, and lost no time in
ringing the door bell.</p>
<p>There was no answer to the summons, and Andy
rang the bell again. Then, of a sudden, the wind
increased, and the door of the mansion was blown
wide open.</p>
<p>Thinking somebody had unfastened the door
and been unable to hold it against the wind, the
acrobatic youth entered the hallway beyond, and
was followed by Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse us, but we came in to get out of the
storm,&rdquo; said Andy, trying to see around him, for
with the darkness outside the hallway was pitch
black.</p>
<p>To his astonishment nobody answered. A gust
of wind came into the hallway and lifting a picture
from its nail hurled it to the floor with a crash.
Then Pepper caught the door and shut and bolted
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody here?&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>Nobody answered, and each of the cadets caught
the other by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess the door just blew open,&rdquo; stammered
Andy. The situation was so unusual he knew not
what to say. Here they were in a strange house
with nobody to speak to them.</p>
<p>The boys could not see a thing, saving when the
lightning outside lit up the scene. They felt their
way through the hallway to a door and entered
what appeared to be a parlor. The apartment
had a musty smell, as if it had not been opened
for a long time. The blinds were closed but the
slats were open and through these faint light
showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if this house was deserted,
too,&rdquo; remarked Pepper. &ldquo;Gracious, the whole
neighborhood must be moving out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody lives here, I am sure of that,&rdquo;
answered his chum. &ldquo;Out in the hall I smelt the
odor of fried onions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us walk back to the kitchen and find out,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>A flash of lightning made the boys pause for a
moment. Then they walked to the end of the
hallway and entered a dining room. Here a
window was open and through this the rain was
sweeping wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of this place must be away,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;Gosh! how it rains!&rdquo; he added, as he shut
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the quaint silver set!&rdquo; said Pepper,
his eyes catching sight of the service on a sideboard.
&ldquo;That must be pretty old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up a silver dish and Andy picked up
another. As they were looking at the silver pieces
they heard a door open and felt a sudden gust of
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; commended Pepper,
when he fell back in sudden alarm. For from
out of a dark corner an old man had appeared.
He wore a long, white beard and his straggling
hair was of the same color. In his hands he
carried a short shotgun and this he had leveled
straight ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burglars! thieves! robbers!&rdquo; he screamed.
&ldquo;Drop my silver plate or I will shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>His manner was so stern and wild that the two
cadets lost no time in setting down the silver
pieces they had picked up. The old man continued
to point his shotgun, first at Andy and then
at Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard there were burglars in this vicinity,&rdquo;
he said, in a croaking voice. &ldquo;But I did not think
you would dare to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not burglars!&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! I know better! You cannot deceive
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are schoolboys and we came in here to get
out of the storm,&rdquo; explained Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it! You are burglars! Those
uniforms are merely a disguise. You were after
my precious silver plate! The world-renowned
Robertson silver plate! But you shan&rsquo;t have it!
Jabez Trask knows how to protect his own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of the old man&rsquo;s name the
cadets started. This then, was the man for whom
Bert Field was seeking. Certainly as strange an
individual as the tall, thin youth himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trask, you are making a mistake,&rdquo; said
Pepper, as calmly as he could. &ldquo;We did not come
here to steal, we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not listen! I shall hand you over to the
authorities for entering my house! I saw you
sneaking around this morning&mdash;one of you at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know better&mdash;I saw you quite plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the boys did not answer. Pepper, however,
wondered if the person seen sneaking around
had been the mysterious Bert Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you fellows to back into the corner,&rdquo;
went on Jabez Trask, after a painful pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; commenced Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word&mdash;until I call an officer of
the law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not criminals,&rdquo; cried Pepper stubbornly.
&ldquo;We belong to Putnam Hall military
academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it! You came here with the
intention of robbing me of my precious plate and
other things. But you did not think I&rsquo;d get after
you with my shotgun!&rdquo; added the old man cunningly.
&ldquo;You thought you would have me at your
mercy! But I have outwitted you! Ha! ha! it
was well done, not so? Back into the corner, I
say, and open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command was such a pre-emptory one that
the cadets obeyed. Andy opened the door. Beyond
was a small storeroom, having a narrow window
which was barred from the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In you go, you young villains!&rdquo; cried Jabez
Trask, and held the muzzle of the shotgun on a
line with their breasts. Fearing that in his excitement
he would pull the trigger, the two cadets
stepped back into the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now kick the door shut with your foot, and
be quick about it,&rdquo; went on the old man, to
Pepper, and aimed the weapon straight at The
Imp.</p>
<p>The door was closed as the man desired, and in
a twinkling Jabez Trask stepped up close and
turned the key in the lock. It was a heavy door,
with an equally effective lock, and the cadets knew
that they were prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! very well done, I do declare!&rdquo;
chuckled the old man, after the door was fastened.
&ldquo;A neat trick, if I do say it myself, a clever trick!
It takes a smart man to get the best of Jabez
Trask. You thought I&rsquo;d shoot you, didn&rsquo;t you?
Well, let me tell you that the shotgun isn&rsquo;t loaded
and hasn&rsquo;t been for a month! But now I am going
to load it, and load it well. If you try to break
out&mdash;well, your blood will be on your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy and Pepper did not reply. In the dim
light of the little storeroom they looked at each
other questioningly. They were in a serious predicament.
What would be the outcome of this
remarkable adventure?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A SEND-OFF FOR JOSIAH CRABTREE</span></h2>
<p>Andy and Pepper heard the old man leave the
dining room and then, excepting for the occasional
rumble of thunder in the distance, all became
quiet around them. The sudden shower was
passing away to the eastward, and soon the rain
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if this isn&rsquo;t the worst yet!&rdquo; exclaimed
the acrobatic youth, after looking at the narrow
window with its iron bars. &ldquo;Pep, this is as bad
as the lock-up at the school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Andy. We are certainly
prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And accused of attempted burglary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody in Cedarville will
believe that charge, after we tell our story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but they may think we were up to some
trick&mdash;especially after that affair of the bell
clapper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;ll come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come soon enough if we try to break out
of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the boys tried to open the door. But
the key was still on the other side and they could
not turn it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing to smash it down with either,&rdquo;
said Pepper, gazing around the storeroom. The
apartment contained nothing but some odds and
ends of books and bric-a-brac and an old ice-box
which was empty.</p>
<p>Pepper knocked on the door, but for several
minutes there was no reply to this summons.
Then came the nervous tones of Jabez Trask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet, or I&rsquo;ll shoot right through the
door!&rdquo; shrilled the old man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got ye! You
can&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to talk this matter over,&rdquo; said The
Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. You can do your talking after I
have put you in the hands of the law!&rdquo; And then
the old man seemed to walk to another part of the
mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to get out somehow!&rdquo; said Andy
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Let us
examine the floor. Maybe some of the boards are
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Both boys got down and lit matches and examined
the floor with care. Pepper moved the old
ice-box in doing this, and a long ice-pick fell from
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, I can use this as a pry!&rdquo; said the
cadet. &ldquo;Wait till I find a board that looks a little
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently he found a board that looked inviting
and he managed to get the ice-pick in the crack
beside it. By working with care he loosened one
end of the board and it came up several inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coal cellar below,&rdquo; he said, as he caught
sight of some shiny pieces of coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we can get into that cellar I guess we
can get out of the house,&rdquo; answered his chum.</p>
<p>Making as little noise as possible, the two
cadets raised up the board and then took up that
next to it. This left an opening just wide enough
for them to squeeze through. They looked down
and saw that the coal was but a few feet beneath
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; said Pepper and let himself down
with care. As his feet touched the coal some of it
slid away, making considerable noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; whispered Andy. &ldquo;The old
man may be listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make that noise,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;Come on, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Andy dropped down on the coal and both boys
left the bin and came out into the cellar proper.
It was quite dark and they stumbled over some
ironware and crocks. The ironware made a crash
that could be heard all through the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! Who is that?&rdquo; they heard the old man
yell, and then he came running across the floor
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, or we&rsquo;ll be caught again!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper. &ldquo;I see a way out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had espied a back entrance to the cellar.
To this he ran, with Andy close behind him.
They pushed open a door and ran up a flight of
stone steps. Above was the back yard, close to the
kitchen of the house.</p>
<p>The cadets did not wait to look around them,
but made a straight dash across the yard toward
a barn. They skirted this building and as they
did so Pepper gave a cry of wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Andy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy&mdash;running through the trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy Jack and I met at the church, Bert
Field! He must have been spying around here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s the one the old man said he saw
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>They looked and saw the tall, thin youth disappear
in a grove of trees lining the main road.
Then, a few minutes later, they saw him walking
down the road as fast as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is certainly something queer about that
boy,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is something queer about the old
man, too,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But, come on, unless
you want Jabez Trask to fill you full of shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was now at the door of the
mansion and he held his shotgun in his hands.
The cadets darted out of sight and took good care
to keep out of range of the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an adventure for you,&rdquo; said Pepper,
after they had covered quite a distance. &ldquo;I rather
think I&rsquo;ll keep away from strange houses after
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the old man will come to Putnam
Hall to make trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain had ceased and the sky was brightening.
The cadets went on to a fork of the road
and then reached a path they knew ran down to
the lake front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely the <i>Alice</i> had returned to the
Hall,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not blame Jack for doing
it, in such a rain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, Andy. But let us look around a little
and see. Maybe he tied up at some boathouse
during the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys walked to the edge of the lake
and looked up and down the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper, and pointed
up the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure that&rsquo;s the <i>Alice</i>?&rdquo; queried his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d know her as far as I could see her.&rdquo;
Pepper raised his voice: &ldquo;Sloop ahoy! On board
the <i>Alice</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first his cry was not heard. Then Jack
caught sight of the pair standing on a rock,
and waved his hand in return. The mainsail of
the sloop was thrown over, and the <i>Alice</i> came
slowly up to the rock and Andy and Pepper leaped
on board. Then a straight course was laid for
Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tied up at Paul&rsquo;s boathouse when it started
to rain,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;It was certainly
a heavy shower, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you managed to keep dry,&rdquo; came from
Stuffer. &ldquo;Have some peanuts,&rdquo; he added, diving
into a pocket and bringing up a handful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we managed to keep dry,&rdquo; answered
Andy. &ldquo;But we had a remarkable time doing it.&rdquo;
And then he and Pepper told of their adventure
at old Jabez Trask&rsquo;s mansion. The others listened
in wonder to what they had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old man must be a tartar,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; mebbe he&rsquo;ll come to the school to
make trouble fer ye,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;But if he
does sure yez can have him arristed fer false imprisonment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll come to the
school,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;I imagine he is the
kind of a man to keep by himself&mdash;one who hates
publicity.&rdquo; And he was right, Jabez Trask did
not come to the school, nor did he report the affair
to the Cedarville authorities. There was a reason
for this, as we shall learn later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t get your basket, Pepper?&rdquo;
said Jack, just as the school dock was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll get something of the sort in Cedarville,
and send it to my aunt,&rdquo; was the answer,
and the lad was as good as his word. He found
the basket maker had removed to town, and there
procured a basket that pleased his relative very
much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know one thing I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said Pepper to
Jack, the next morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet that
Bert Field and have a talk with him. There is
something odd about his wanting to meet such a
queer stick as Jabez Trask, and about his wanting
to know the location of that haunted mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll meet him while we are in camp,
Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday passed quietly in and around Putnam
Hall, and on Monday morning the cadets commenced
their preparations for going into camp.
Each student was allowed to take along a dress-suit
case full of clothing, the suit-cases being
transported to the camp by wagon, along with the
tents, the cooking outfits, and blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! I&rsquo;ve got good news!&rdquo; cried Dale,
bursting into the dormitory where Jack and some
others were sorting out their things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell it quick,&rdquo; returned the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree isn&rsquo;t going to camp with us. He
has a call to come to Albany on some family
business. Only Captain Putnam and Mr. Strong
are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be to Crabtree for staying away,&rdquo; said
Andy solemnly. &ldquo;What a blessing it would be if
he would stay away forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; put in Fred, who, though a
comparatively new pupil at the Hall, detested the
first assistant teacher as cordially as did the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, if Crabtree is going away we ought to
give him something to remember us by,&rdquo; came
from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let us present him with a gold watch
and chain,&rdquo; answered Dale sarcastically. &ldquo;We
might have it inscribed as follows: &lsquo;To our much
beloved friend, The Honorable Josiah Crabtree,
A. M., P. M., X. X. M., and all the rest, as a slight
token of our love, esteem, friendship, well-wishes,
and undying affection.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d fall dead if he got it,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we present him with an alarm clock,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;A good loud one. I saw a special
sale of &rsquo;em in Cedarville for seventy-five cents
each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll get
one, I&rsquo;ll get another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box is now open for contributions to the
Crabtree Alarm Clock Collection!&rdquo; announced
The Imp, grinning broadly. &ldquo;Who wants to chip
in to get our beloved teacher a few clocks with
good alarms attached?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea took like wildfire and in a short time
the cadets collected several dollars. Pepper and
Dale were chosen to get the clocks, and they
bought five, each with an &ldquo;alarm&rdquo; that was loud
and long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be careful to set them just right,&rdquo;
said The Imp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think about five minutes apart will do,&rdquo; said
Andy, and so it was arranged. The boys watched
their chances, and after winding up the clocks
managed to place them in two dress-suit cases
which Josiah Crabtree had packed to take with
him. They knew that the teacher was going to
take the boat from Cedarville at five o&rsquo;clock and
timed the clock alarms accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get down to Cedarville to see the
fun,&rdquo; said Pepper. This was an easy matter, for,
because of going away in the morning, the cadets
were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased,
Captain Putnam and George Strong being too
busy getting ready for the encampment to pay
much attention to them.</p>
<p>A crowd of the cadets went to Cedarville on
their bicycles and some walked. Josiah Crabtree
went in the school carryall, driven by Peleg
Snuggers.</p>
<p>The teacher was bachelor yet he had quite an
eye for the ladies, and when he saw a pretty widow
he knew walking down to the steamboat dock he
bowed and tipped his hat and asked her to ride
with him. She accepted and entered the carryall,
and then both walked out on the dock to await the
arrival of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes yet!&rdquo; announced Pepper. &ldquo;And
then for some fun!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Josiah Crabtree found a seat for the widow,
and both chatted pleasantly. In the meantime a
crowd commenced to collect on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dearly love music,&rdquo; the widow was
saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music is grand,&rdquo; answered Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;I often think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the teacher thought was not expressed, for
just then from one of the dress-suit cases came the
shrill rattle of one of the alarm clocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">OFF FOR THE ENCAMPMENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; shrieked the widow. &ldquo;What
in the world is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; answered the teacher, as he
surveyed the suit-case in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to get up!&rdquo; observed a man standing
nearby. And at this sally several persons laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently are carrying an alarm clock,&rdquo;
said the widow to Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;wish the thing would stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Br-r-r-r-r-i-ng! went the alarm clock as loudly as
ever, and now all the people on the dock commenced
to laugh. The widow grew red and the
teacher bit his lip savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be some joke of the boys,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Presently the alarm gave out, and Josiah
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you were saying about music&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began,
with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Professor Crabtree! I think music
is grand. I love to sit in church and listen to
the deep tones of the organ, and the singing of
the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Br-r-r-r-r-r-i-ng! went the second alarm clock,
in a tone louder than the other. Josiah Crabtree
gave a jump and the widow screamed. Br-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-i-ng!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me! Did you wind that thing up
again!&rdquo; gasped the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam, I didn&rsquo;t touch the confounded
thing!&rdquo; snapped Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;This is&mdash;er&mdash;a
trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alarm continued to rattle and the crowd
on the dock roared. The teacher caught up the
suit-case and started to open it in a hurry. He
was not careful and out dropped several dress-shirts
and some socks and underwear. This made
the crowd laugh again and Josiah Crabtree grew
sour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think this a laughing matter, but I
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is a trick, and if I find out
who is guilty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then he pulled out one of
the offending clocks and hurled it into the waters
of the lake. By this time the second clock had
run down and quietness was restored. The teacher
found this, but left it in the suit-case. The other
clocks were in his other baggage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The boat was coming in and soon the passengers
commenced to come ashore. Josiah Crabtree
started to talk to the widow again and had just got
her to smile when there came another rattle. He
dropped the suit-case like a hot potato and this
time the crowd fairly howled. And the cadets,
who were watching from behind a pile of boxes,
howled too.</p>
<p>Br-r-r-r-r-r-i-ng! went one alarm clock, and a
minute later still another joined in. The noise
was great and the teacher did not know what to
do. In his rage he jumped on the suit-case,
smashing the middle flat. But the clocks rattled
on more viciously, it would seem, than ever, and
now the fifth and last added to the racket. Everybody
stopped to enjoy the fun and a large crowd
collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a fire-alarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he want an ambulance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a clock vendor. Anybody want to
buy an alarm clock cheap?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shut up, all of you!&rdquo; roared Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sell clocks! This is a trick! Oh,
those cadets! I&rsquo;d like to wring their necks! What
a disgrace!&rdquo; And he jumped on the suit-case
again. &ldquo;Will you stop? Oh, what a racket! I
shall go mad!&rdquo; And then picking up the offending
baggage he fairly ran on the steamboat and disappeared
into the cabin, the last of the clocks still
rattling shrilly. The widow hurried in another
direction, and the teacher did not dare to go near
her during the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that send-off was worth the
price,&rdquo; said Pepper, after he and his chums had
laughed themselves sore. &ldquo;What a figure he did
cut, trying to stop the clocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t the widow mad!&rdquo; put in Jack.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never speak to him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree will remember those clocks as long as
he lives,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him another when he comes back&mdash;just
for a memento of the occasion,&rdquo; said The Imp.
And then in high spirits over the success of their
trick, the cadets returned to Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>For the time being, lessons were a thing of the
past, and that evening the students had a good
deal of fun, in one way or another. Some of the
crowds went from one dormitory to another, and
pillow fights were frequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ritter gang is coming down the hall,&rdquo;
announced Joe Nelson, about ten o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Look
out for them, for they may have something worse
than pillows and stuffed clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>It was well that Joe issued the warning, for less
than five minutes later Ritter came on, followed
by Coulter, Paxton, and four others. They had
pillows and stuffed clubs, but the latter were
stuffed with sawdust and were quite hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repel boarders!&rdquo; sang out Andy, and caught
up a water pitcher full of water. &ldquo;Back, if you
don&rsquo;t want a ducking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; roared Reff Ritter, and
struck at Pepper with his club. The Imp ducked
and then caught the bully by the foot and yanked
him down.</p>
<p>In a moment more the fight raged furiously.
Pillows, shoes, soap, books and other articles
sailed through the air. Jack was struck in the ear
by Coulter and he retaliated by filling the fellow&rsquo;s
mouth with soft soap that was handy in a dish.
Andy wet Ritter and Paxton with the contents of
the pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up! that ain&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; roared Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need a bath, to wash up your reputation,
Paxton!&rdquo; answered the acrobatic cadet.</p>
<p>Ritter had arisen to his feet, and watching his
chance he drew something from his pocket. He
was about to hurl it at Jack&rsquo;s head when Pepper
caught his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Give me
that!&rdquo; And he tried to get the article from the
bully&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; cried the bully, in alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall!&rdquo; And then Pepper and Ritter
commenced to tussle. The Imp went down, but
still kept his hand over that of his enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ough! my hand! Do you want to cut it?&rdquo;
suddenly howled the bully, and then opened his
hand. A large lump of rough glass fell to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; demanded Dale, coming
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter was going to throw that at Jack&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered the bully, doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass, I declare!&rdquo; said Dale, picking it up.
&ldquo;Say, Ritter, this is no thing to use in a fight
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to use it. I only had it in my
hand,&rdquo; was the lame reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to throw it at Jack&rsquo;s head&mdash;I
am positive of it,&rdquo; said Pepper firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were, Ritter, you&rsquo;re a villain!&rdquo; declared
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Stuffer, and now the
fight came to a sudden stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter was going to throw a lump of rough
glass at Jack&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;He might
have cut Jack badly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; was the bully&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the glass. He had it aimed at Jack
when I caught his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets gathered around and looked at the
glass and then at Ritter. Nobody had known
about the glass but the bully and even his cohorts
were surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were going to throw that at me, eh?&rdquo;
said Jack, sternly, as he looked Ritter squarely in
the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather take Pepper&rsquo;s word for it than
yours. It was a contemptible piece of business,
Ritter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have cut Jack badly,&rdquo; said Fred.
&ldquo;The glass is very sharp on one side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I wasn&rsquo;t going to use it,&rdquo; cried the
bully. &ldquo;I held it up just to scare Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never believe that, Ritter. You are a
coward as well as a bully. Now get out of here
and be quick, or I&rsquo;ll knock you down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to fight here,&rdquo; said the bully,
growing slightly pale. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
do, Ruddy. I&rsquo;ll fight you to a finish when we are
in camp. Do you dare do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; muttered the young major;
and then the boys from the other dormitories
withdrew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a mean, dirty trick,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;A chunk of glass, of all things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows up Ritter in his true character,&rdquo;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be drummed out of this school,&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, will you fight him again?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly if he wants it. I am not afraid of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bully, but he is strong,&rdquo; said Dale, and
there the talk had to come to an end, for the
monitor put in an appearance and made them go
to bed.</p>
<p>The cadets were to have breakfast at an early
hour and promptly at six o&rsquo;clock the drum roll
aroused the lads. Pepper ran to the window and
looked out</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear as a bell!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A dandy day for
marching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He commenced to dress and so did the others.
They put on their marching uniforms, and all
presented a fine appearance when they assembled
for roll-call. Drill was dispensed with, and the
cadets lost no time in eating their breakfast in
the mess-hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>It had been noised around that the cadets were
to march to Lake Caboy and quite a crowd from
the village and from the neighboring farms
gathered to see them depart. The wagons were
already on the way, loaded high with the baggage
and the camping outfit. It had been decided that
the march to the lake was to be made in two days
instead of one, so that no cadet would get tired out
from the tramp. The first night out was to be
spent at a place called Hayville, and there the
wagons were to await the arrival of the battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion attention!&rdquo; called out Major Jack
Ruddy, after breakfast was over and the drum had
sounded again. And the companies formed in
haste and the cadets stood as stiff as ramrods.</p>
<p>Then Captain Putnam made a short speech,
telling of the encampment, and stating he hoped
all would pass off pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward march!&rdquo; was the next command from
the young major, and then the drums sounded out,
and off the battalion started across the campus.
&ldquo;By columns of fours!&rdquo; came the next order.
And so they passed out on the highway, with
Captain Putnam and George Strong on horseback
in the lead, and the young major following. The
music came from two snare drums, a bass drum
and three fifers, and could be heard a long distance
away. The two companies made a fine appearance
and the onlookers applauded vigorously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time, boys!&rdquo; said one of the
teachers, who had been left behind, to superintend
the alterations on the school buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to!&rdquo; called back Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep out of mischief,&rdquo; added the teacher,
who understood The Imp&rsquo;s fun-loving disposition
only too well.</p>
<p>On marched the boys, along the lake and then
taking to a highway that led directly to Lake
Caboy. As they passed farm after farm, the folks
came out to look them over and give them a cheer.</p>
<p>Dinner was had at a place called Dodd&rsquo;s Corners,
and after a brief rest the march was resumed towards
Hayville. Here the road was not so good,
and some of the cadets were glad when, at four
o&rsquo;clock, they came in sight of their resting place
for the night. But here a great surprise awaited
Captain Putnam and all of the others. The
baggage train, consisting of four large wagons,
was missing with all of their outfit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">ON THE TRAIL OF THE WAGONS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the wagons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought they were going to meet us here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they come on the same road we took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they missed the way, what are we to do for
the night? We can&rsquo;t stay out doors without
tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the questions asked and remarks
made as the cadets came to a halt, broke
ranks, and surrounded Captain Putnam and
George Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand this,&rdquo; said the head of
the school, his face showing his concern. &ldquo;I told
the wagon men to come straight here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they know the road?&rdquo; asked Mr. Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said they did, although none of them
had been over it before. It&rsquo;s straight enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>All looked around in perplexity, and while
doing so were approached by a farmer who lived
in the vicinity. He said he had seen nothing of
the wagons, although he had looked for them. To
this farmer belonged the field which Captain Putnam
had rented for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well scatter and make a search,&rdquo;
said the young major, after talking the matter
over with the master of Putnam Hall. &ldquo;Perhaps
the wagons took to some side road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was agreed that the cadets should look for
the wagons, and permission was given to stay
away for two hours, no longer. Several parties
were formed, one being made up of Jack, Pepper,
Andy and Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; said the youth who
loved to eat, when the party was out of hearing
of the others. &ldquo;I may be away off, but it won&rsquo;t do
any harm to tell what I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is in your brain, Stuffer?&rdquo; asked
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think some of the Pornell Academy students
are responsible for the non-appearance of those
wagons,&rdquo; answered Stuffer, as he commenced to
chew on some gum in lieu of eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; demanded
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was down to Cedarville last night,
and I saw Roy Bock, Bat Sedley, and several
others quizzing Peleg Snuggers about where we
were going to camp and all that. As I passed
them I heard Bock mention the wagons, and he
asked who was going to drive &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like the Bock crowd to do
such a thing!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Just to get square
with us for the tricks we have played on &rsquo;em in the
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could they get possession of the
wagons?&rdquo; asked Pepper. &ldquo;Do you suppose they
played highwaymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Bock and his gang are willing
to do anything, I guess, to square old scores. But
most likely they directed the drivers to the wrong
road. They could easily do that, if the men didn&rsquo;t
know the road in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case it is up to us to find those
wagons as soon as possible,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;If we
had to stay out all night without tents the Pornell
students would have the laugh on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were walking along the road by which
they had come. They kept their eyes on the
ground, and presently saw some tracks that interested
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where some wagons turned off into
yonder field,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;The question is, Were
they our wagons or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us follow the tracks and see,&rdquo; returned
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>They crossed the field and came out on a back
road that led through a dense patch of trees. Beyond
this were two other roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wagons took that to the left,&rdquo; announced
Stuffer. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Wish we could
find them and get supper! I&rsquo;m mortally hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ever otherwise?&rdquo; asked Jack
&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll not have anything to eat until this
mystery is cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on for over a mile, and came to a
spot where the trees were interspersed with heavy
brushwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is one of the wagons,&rdquo; shouted Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is another!&rdquo; cried the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole four are here,&rdquo; came, a minute
later, from Pepper. &ldquo;But where are the men and
the horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wagons stood among the trees and bushes.
The eight horses that had been hitched to them
were missing, and so were the four drivers. The
cadets looked around, but the spot appeared to
be deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve found the wagons anyway,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we to get them to Hayville without
teams?&rdquo; asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe we can borrow horses
nearby, although I don&rsquo;t see any farmhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, can&rsquo;t I get something to eat?&rdquo; went on
Stuffer pleadingly. &ldquo;I am hollow down to my
shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;if you can find anything,&rdquo;
answered the young major, and the cadet who
loved to eat lost no time in locating what he
wanted on one of the wagons.</p>
<p>The boys walked into the woods a distance, but
saw nothing of the horses. Then they came back
to the wagons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of us had better stand guard with our
guns while two go back and tell Captain Putnam,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll detail you, Pepper and Stuffer,
to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
stay away too long, for it is getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back as soon as possible. And you,
Stuffer, don&rsquo;t eat too much or you&rsquo;ll get sick,&rdquo;
added the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never get sick from eating,&rdquo; answered
Stuffer, calmly munching on a biscuit, his sixth.</p>
<p>Jack and Andy hurried through the woods,
taking a short cut in the direction of Hayville.
They had covered less than a quarter of a mile
when to their surprise they came to a tumbled-down
cottage with a big barn attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an out-of-the-way place for a building!&rdquo;
cried Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was built before the trees grew up,&rdquo;
answered his chum. &ldquo;Maybe&mdash;Wait, get down
out of sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack dropped behind some bushes and the acrobatic
youth followed his example. The young
major had seen two boys coming from the old
cottage. They were headed for the dilapidated
barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Bock and Bat Sedley!&rdquo; murmured Andy.
&ldquo;Jack, I reckon we are on the right track!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely they have the horses here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what became of the drivers of the
wagons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose those fellows would make
them prisoners, do you? They&rsquo;d think they were
going to be robbed and would put up a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I reckon the Bock gang played some sort
of trick on them. Maybe they got &rsquo;em to go into
a roadhouse for refreshments and then drove off
with the wagons on the sly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet&mdash;it depends upon how many
of the crowd are here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Still keeping out of sight behind the bushes,
Jack and Andy watched the two Pornell students
closely. They saw the pair enter the barn. Then
they came out again and went back to the old cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;I think they are alone,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;And if they are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the best of &rsquo;em somehow,&rdquo; finished
his chum.</p>
<p>With caution the two cadets sneaked along
through the bushes and up to the side of the dilapidated
cottage. Looking through a broken-out
window they beheld Roy Bock and Bat Sedley
seated on benches, smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you suppose Carey will get
back?&rdquo; Bock was asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t come for an hour or two,&rdquo;
answered Sedley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have taken one of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t dare, for he had to pass the very
roadhouse where we left those drivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, those drivers must have been astonished
when they found the wagons gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! That will teach &rsquo;em a lesson not to
let strangers treat them. All of them were glad
enough to be treated at Plunkett&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Plunkett still with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. He said he&rsquo;d stay, so they
wouldn&rsquo;t suspect him of having anything to do
with running off with the wagons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, how mad those cadets and Captain Putnam
must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves &rsquo;em right. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten how we
got it in the neck, the last time we tried to play
a joke on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the talk ran on. In the meantime Jack and
Andy had heard enough and convinced themselves
that Bock and Sedley were alone and that they
did not expect anybody else for some time to
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch!&rdquo; whispered the young major.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make them prisoners! Just wait till I get
a strap or two from the harness on the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried to the barn, and presently came back
with several straps. Then he gave his chum a few
directions.</p>
<p>A moment later Roy Bock and Bat Sedley were
dumbfounded to find themselves confronted by
the two cadets, one with a drawn sword and the
other with a leveled rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo; ordered Andy,
in the sternest voice he could command, and this
order made Sedley, who was something of a
coward, scream in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot me! Please don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then up with your hands!&rdquo; And in keen
fright Sedley put his hands over his head and
kept them there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s Jack Ruddy and Andy Snow!&rdquo;
murmured Roy Bock. &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with those hands, Bock, or I&rsquo;ll order Snow
to fire!&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;I want you to understand
this is no laughing matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t dare to shoot us,&rdquo; said Bock, but
his voice showed his uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it! You are nothing but
highway robbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are not, we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to put up those hands or not?&rdquo;
demanded Andy. &ldquo;This is a repeating rifle, and
it is fully loaded.&rdquo; He spoke the truth, for
Captain Putnam had allowed the cadets to load up
before starting on the search, not knowing what
might turn up. The boys, however, had been
cautioned to be very careful.</p>
<p>Slowly Roy Bock elevated his hands. He was
uneasy, for he did not know what to expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take a joke,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t find this a joke when you
get through with it,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Stealing horses
and wagons is a State&rsquo;s prison offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the statement merely to scare the
Pornell students, and his words had their full
effect on Sedley if not on Bock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t have us locked up!&rdquo; cried
Sedley. &ldquo;It was only done in fun, really it was!
We didn&rsquo;t touch anything in the wagons, and the
horses are safe in the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; asked Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? All of the cadets are out looking for
the wagons,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Andy, keep them
covered, and shoot if I tell you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Major!&rdquo; answered the private, with
true military precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, what are you going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Bock, as Jack slipped his sword into its scabbard
and advanced with the straps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon find out,&rdquo; was the cool reply.
&ldquo;Now, no monkey work&mdash;unless you want to get
shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sedley was badly scared, and it was an easy
matter to bind his hands behind him and tie him
fast to a door handle at one side of the room.
Bock looked as if he wanted to fight or run away,
but having the muzzle of the rifle pointed directly
at his head made him waver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have your way,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
get square sometime, don&rsquo;t forget that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are only getting what is coming to you,
Bock,&rdquo; answered Jack, as he tied the Pornell
student fast to another door. &ldquo;Now I reckon you
won&rsquo;t get away until your friends come for you,&rdquo;
he added, and then motioned to Andy to withdraw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Where did
you leave those drivers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Maddock&rsquo;s roadhouse,&rdquo; said Sedley. &ldquo;But
I reckon they are not there now. Most likely they
are out looking for the teams and wagons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE CAVE IN THE WOODS</span></h2>
<p>Leaving the Pornell students prisoners in the
old cottage, Andy and Jack hurried to the barn.
There were all of the horses, tied up in the stalls
and in the portion devoted in years gone by to
threshing. They had suffered no injury and had
been fed from bags of oats taken along by the
drivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take them over to the wagons and hitch
them up,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;There is no
use of reporting to Captain Putnam. We can
bring the wagons right in with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His chum was willing, and in a few minutes
they had the animals out of the barn. They were
ordinary work horses, so there was small danger
of their running away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can manage them,&rdquo; said the young
major. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead the bunch and you can follow
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Thus the start was made through the woods,
and before long they came in sight of the four
wagons, with Pepper and Stuffer on guard. The
latter was munching on some cake he had managed
to locate in a box on one of the wagons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, if they haven&rsquo;t found the horses!&rdquo;
cried Pepper joyfully. &ldquo;This is famous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you locate them?&rdquo; questioned
Stuffer, hiding the cake from the young major.</p>
<p>The story was soon told, the boys meanwhile
hitching the horses to the wagons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope those Pornell fellows have to remain
at the old cottage all night,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;It
will serve &rsquo;em right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get a crowd and go there and
wipe up the floor with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said the lad who
loved to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what can be done after we get back
to Hayville,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I can drive one
wagon. Can you chaps drive the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; came in a chorus from his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us be off. Captain Putnam will be
much worried until he learns that the outfit is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not without some difficulty the wagons were
turned around and taken to the main road. Then
the horses were urged on, and it was not long
before they came in sight of Hayville. Almost
the first persons they met were Captain Putnam,
George Strong and one of the wagon drivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Safe, eh?&rdquo; cried the master of the Hall. &ldquo;I
am glad to hear it.&rdquo; And his face showed his
relief.</p>
<p>He insisted upon knowing the details and Jack
told us as much as he deemed necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a schoolboy trick, sir,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I guess they meant no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I shall make a complaint to
Doctor Pornell,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;He ought to know how his students are conducting
themselves. It was largely, however, the
fault of the drivers. One of the older academy
seniors got them to leave their wagons and go into
the roadhouse with him. There he treated them
and got them to take their eyes off my property&mdash;and
then the other students ran off with the outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t make the trick turn out as
intended,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the outfit
back,&mdash;and it is only a little after supper time.
We can get supper, and get up our tents, too,
before it is very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very thankful for what you cadets did,&rdquo;
went on the master of the Hall. &ldquo;I shall not
forget it. It was lucky that you struck the right
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The drummers were called in and they rolled
their drums,&mdash;a signal that the outfit had been
found. This brought in the cadets from all over,
and soon, while some were helping the regular
cooks get supper, others were at work erecting
the tents.</p>
<p>The only cadets who were not glad that the
outfit had been found were Reff Ritter and his
crowd. They were jealous of what Jack and his
chums had accomplished, and could not help but
show it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ruddy crowd will now be more stuck up
than ever,&rdquo; grumbled Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! it wasn&rsquo;t so much to do,&rdquo; added
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was more than you ever did for the school,
Coulter,&rdquo; answered Fred, who chanced to overhear
the remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; sneered Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ruddy and his crowd hadn&rsquo;t found the
wagons we might have stopped at the hotel over
night,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay there anyway
than out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the Hayville Hotel would have hard
work to accommodate so many cadets,&rdquo; said Fred,
with a smile. &ldquo;It has about six rooms for guests.&rdquo;
And then he walked away, leaving the Ritter
crowd to continue their fault-finding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The cadets were not used to marching over the
rough roads, and a good many of them were tired
out and glad enough to turn in and go to bed.
But some of them had to stand guard, and among
these were Andy and Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, let us go back into the woods and see
what became of those Pornell fellows,&rdquo; said
Pepper to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get away, otherwise I would,&rdquo; answered
the young officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing I get up a crowd and go, Jack?
You&rsquo;ll have the guards keep their eyes closed,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But don&rsquo;t let Ritter and his gang spot
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper made a careful canvass and managed
to enlist the services of nine cadets, including
Fred, Dale, Emerald and Bob Grenwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan to scare them&mdash;if they are
still in the woods,&rdquo; said the quartermaster of the
battalion. &ldquo;I was going to try the trick on some
of our own fellows, up at Lake Caboy&mdash;but I&rsquo;d
rather work it on the Pornell crowd,&rdquo; and then
he told what his plan was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scare
&rsquo;em out of their senses!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>With caution the party stole away from the
temporary camp. Several of them carried
bundles, and Bob Grenwood had a big megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hurry, otherwise they may be
gone,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Bock and Sedley were
waiting for Carey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not yet ten o&rsquo;clock and the sky was bright
with stars. The cadets hurried as fast they could,
The Imp leading the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well put on the disguises now,&rdquo;
said he, as soon as they reached the spot where
the wagons had been found. &ldquo;For all we know
they may be coming this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party halted and undid their bundles. Out
rolled some white bedsheets and tall hats made of
white cardboard. The cadets put on the hats and
wound the sheets around them, making them look
like so many ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the phosphorus,&rdquo; said Bob Grenwood
and brought forth a little box. He rubbed some on
his hands, his forehead and his cheeks and the
others did likewise. The phosphorus gave forth
a sickly yellow glow that was ghastly in the
extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Pepper, just as the boys had
finished their ghostly preparations. &ldquo;Here they
come now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>All looked and saw that he was right. From
the direction of the dilapidated cottage four
young fellows were approaching rapidly. They
were Bock and Sedley, their particular chum,
Carey, and Plunkett, the senior who had invited
the wagon drivers into the roadhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surround them,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;And be sure and don&rsquo;t let any of them escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and the ghostlike figures
ranged themselves in a semi-circle in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Bob Grenwood, through the
megaphone. &ldquo;As you value your lives, halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in a low tone, and in amazement the
four Pornell students stopped short. Then Sedley
caught sight of the figures with the glow upon
their faces and he set up a yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts?&rdquo; repeated Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;yo&mdash;you see &rsquo;em?&rdquo; And
Sedley&rsquo;s teeth commenced to chatter. &ldquo;Oh, I wish
I wa&mdash;was ba&mdash;back to Pornell!&rdquo; he wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t ghosts,&rdquo; growled Plunkett. &ldquo;This
is a trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look like ghosts!&rdquo; gasped Carey, who was
as much of a coward as Sedley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo; said Roy Bock.
&ldquo;It must be some of the Putnam Hall cadets&mdash;or
else some of our own crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Bob again, and his companions
repeated the command. Then, as the Bock crowd
stopped, the cadets surrounded them, so that none
of them might slip away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded Bock, who
was evidently the leader, though Plunkett was
older.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to have a good time,&rdquo; said
Bob, in a pleasant voice. &ldquo;We came to treat you&mdash;in
return for giving the Putnam Hall boys so
much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Plunkett. It was
too dark under the trees to distinguish faces,
especially when distorted from the glowing of the
phosphorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said another cadet, for the quartermaster&rsquo;s
plan had been explained to all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to come along. We have a plan
to play another trick on the Putnam Hall
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo; demanded Sedley, who
had recovered from his fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s telling, Bat. But you&rsquo;ll soon know&mdash;when
we get at the feast Oliver has prepared for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Now Oliver was a caterer who had often supplied
the Pornell Academy students with good
things to eat. The mention of his name took the
Bock crowd off their guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a spread for us?&rdquo; demanded
Bock, who was tremendously hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure have, Roy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this rig&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to scare the cadets&mdash;if we
missed you,&rdquo; answered Pepper, in a disguised
voice.</p>
<p>Some more questions were asked, and then Bock
and his crowd agreed to follow the ghostlike
figures through the woods. The cadets kept in
the dark as much as possible and worked hard
to keep their identity a secret. Bock at last concluded
the boys belonged to a new batch of
Pornell students, who had come to that institution
only a short while before. One of these lads had
spoken about giving a feast, in honor of his birthday,
and Bock thought the feast was now on the
way.</p>
<p>Bob Grenwood was something of a hunter, and
during his spare hours he had tramped for many
miles through the woods, looking for game. On
one of these expeditions he had run across a cave
in a hillside, bordering a stream that flowed into
one of the lakes of that vicinity. He had visited
the cave several times and had fixed it up for use,
with a rough bench and table, and a rude fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>To this cave the young quartermaster now led
the way and all of the others followed. When
almost there Bob called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go ahead and see if all is in readiness,&rdquo;
he said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Then he ran into the cave and found a candle
that was there. He cut the candle into six pieces
and lit them all, making quite a light as they
were ranged on the table. He covered the center
of the table with a cloth, resting on several sticks
of wood, so that the cloth would look as if it had
things to eat under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now advance, and prepare for the grand
feast!&rdquo; he called out, and seeing the lights streaming
from the cave the Bock crowd ran forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave!&rdquo; cried Sedley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a spread!&rdquo; added Carey. &ldquo;See the
table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a surprise,&rdquo; murmured Plunkett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what they&rsquo;ve got to eat,&rdquo; came from
Bock, and then the four students marched into
the cave and surrounded the table with its burning
candles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, work quick!&rdquo; cried Bob in a low
voice, and leaped towards some sticks beside the
cave entrance. The others understood, and soon
had the sticks piled up against the opening.
Against the sticks they heaped up some rocks that
were handy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; roared Roy Bock,
wheeling around and trying to get out of the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means you are prisoners of the Putnam
Hall cadets!&rdquo; cried Pepper, throwing off his disguise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE ENCAMPMENT AT LAKE CABOY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought all along they might be fellows from
Putnam Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fools we were to trust them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the remarks made by the
students of Pornell Academy when they found
themselves prisoners in the cave.</p>
<p>In vain they rushed to the entrance, trying to
get out. Bob had some heavy sticks handy and
these were quickly wedged in between the rocks
so that they could not be budged excepting from
the outside. Then more rocks were piled up to
keep the prisoners from breaking the sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; demanded Roy Bock. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
going to let us out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back to the Academy before
morning,&rdquo; added Bat Sedley. &ldquo;Otherwise we&rsquo;ll
get into hot water with Doctor Pornell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
a roof over your head&mdash;and that is more than we
might have had if we hadn&rsquo;t located those
wagons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let up about the wagons, will you?&rdquo;
growled Bock. He felt heartily sick over the outcome
of that trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one way you can get out of this
cave,&rdquo; announced Bob. &ldquo;That is by the back
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The back way?&rdquo; queried Plunkett, looking
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. See that opening in the rocks? Well,
if you squeeze through that you&rsquo;ll come out in a
deep cut, and if you&rsquo;ll follow the cut you&rsquo;ll reach
the woods, not far from the road to your school.
I advise you to take those candles with you though,
for it is pretty dark in the cut, and there are
some bad holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may break our necks!&rdquo; growled Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you are careful. But you may get in
the mud,&rdquo; answered the young quartermaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us out the front way!&rdquo; pleaded Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s back way or nothing,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;You deserve to suffer for the way you treated
us. Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to leave us here alone?&rdquo; cried Sedley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said Emerald. &ldquo;Pleasant drames to
ye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait&mdash;we&rsquo;ll square up!&rdquo; growled Roy
Bock. Then the Putnam Hall cadets took their
departure. The phosphorus no longer showed on
their hands and faces, and they put away the
white sheets and hats for possible future use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they really get out the back way?&rdquo; asked
Fred, as the party hurried for the night&rsquo;s encampment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bob. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll have to
wade through water and mud up to their knees,
and fight their way through a lot of wild blackberry
bushes! They&rsquo;ll be sights to see when they
get back to Pornell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young quartermaster was right in his statement.
The Bock crowd left the cave by the back
way shortly after the departure of the Putnam
Hall cadets. In the cut they had to walk in
muddy water up to their knees, and once Sedley
got stuck in the muck and his cronies had to pull
him out. Bock fell down, and the mud entered
his mouth and nose. Then all of the students got
caught in the wild blackberry bushes and
scratched themselves and tore their clothing.
They did not get back to Pornell Academy until
half-past seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and were
caught by a teacher just as they were trying to
enter by a side door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is the matter with you
young gentlemen!&rdquo; cried the teacher, as he beheld
the mud and blood. &ldquo;Have you been in a smash-up
on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;we were in the woods and got lost
and&mdash;er&mdash;tumbled in a gully,&rdquo; stammered Roy
Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad, Bock! Do you want a
doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo; was the reply. Then
the crowd hurried off to their rooms, while the
teacher reported the matter to Doctor Pornell.</p>
<p>Bock and his cronies thought they would escape
punishment, but this was not to be. Later in the
day Doctor Pornell received a stiff letter from
Captain Putnam informing him of what had been
done with the wagons, and stating he might
possibly take the matter to court unless the guilty
students were properly punished. This worried
the head of the academy, and he had Bock and
the others brought before him. Under sharp
questioning they broke down, and Sedley and
Carey confessed all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into this affair further,&rdquo; said Doctor
Pornell, and the next day he announced that those
who were guilty were to have their holidays for
that term cut off and were to do a number of extra
lessons. He also made the crowd write a letter to
Captain Putnam, apologizing for what they had
done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Pepper and his friends returned to the encampment
and got past the guards without trouble.
The cadets were worn out by the day&rsquo;s doings and
once at rest slept &ldquo;like tops,&rdquo; as Fred expressed
it. There was a little &ldquo;horseplay&rdquo; during the
night, but none of the lads who had been out in
the woods took part in it. In the morning it was
whispered about how the Bock crowd had been
treated, and many of the cadets said it served the
Pornell students right.</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock the wagons were re-loaded and
the march for Lake Caboy was resumed. To
make sure that no further harm should befall the
wagons and their drivers, the turnouts were made
to keep close to the battalion.</p>
<p>By noon the end of the lake was gained and
they had their dinner at a summer hotel located
there. Not far away was the hotel where the
Fords were stopping, and Jack, Pepper and Andy
obtained permission to run over and see Laura and
Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa has hired a gasolene launch,&rdquo; said
Laura. &ldquo;So you can expect to see us on the water
more or less. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to take you
out&mdash;that is, if you care to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just try us and see&mdash;if we can get permission
to leave camp,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack ought to be able to get permission&mdash;being
a major,&rdquo; answered Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must remember we are all under
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; replied the young
officer. &ldquo;I am in command only during drill and
parade, and like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll come up anyway, sooner or later,&rdquo;
said Laura; and a few minutes later the cadets
had to hurry back to where they had left the others,
for the drum was already rolling to call the boys
together.</p>
<p>As Jack, Andy and Pepper passed a corner of
the summer hotel where the cadets had had dinner
they caught sight of a tall youth just leaving the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there is that Bert Field!&rdquo; cried Pepper.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t much time,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>Pepper ran up to the tall, thin boy and caught
him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! How are you?&rdquo; he said, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;how do you do?&rdquo; stammered Bert
Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you that I know where you can
find the man you were looking for, Jabez Trask,&rdquo;
went on Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I have found him,&rdquo; answered the
strange boy, in some confusion. &ldquo;That is&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
know where he lives now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought I saw you around his mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this announcement Bert Field looked around
nervously. Evidently he was a boy who was not
strong physically, and one who had been &ldquo;kept
down&rdquo; by others. He did not seem to have much
of a will of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;How did you happen to see me?&rdquo; he
stammered. He was evidently ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t time. I&rsquo;ve
got to be on the march, with the rest of the cadets.
We are going into camp up the lake this afternoon.
And by the way, it is not far from an old
deserted mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Bert Field was now all attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Robertson mill. You are looking for
that place, too, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some young lady friends of mine. But I&rsquo;ve
got to hurry. If you come up the lake, won&rsquo;t you
call at our camp and see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I will,&rdquo; answered Bert Field. He
looked keenly at Pepper then of a sudden caught
his arm. &ldquo;Say, you are a boy like myself and you
look honest,&rdquo; he went on in a low voice. &ldquo;Would
you&mdash;would you help me to&mdash;to&mdash;do something?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it was fair and square I would,&rdquo; answered
Pepper, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fair enough. But it is&mdash;is dangerous&mdash;at
least it may become dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you call on me at our encampment and
we&rsquo;ll talk it over,&rdquo; answered Pepper, and ran off.
Then of a sudden he turned back. &ldquo;Is it money
you need?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is, I don&rsquo;t need any just now. I may
need some later on though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do what I can for you. I like your
looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I like yours,&rdquo; answered Bert Field,
heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up to your encampment
sooner or later. I can&rsquo;t come right away,&rdquo; and he
hurried off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Pepper had barely time to get into the ranks
before the advance up the lake was resumed. As
he marched along The Imp could not help but
think over what Bert Field had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly a queer stick,&rdquo; he reasoned.
&ldquo;And there is some mystery about him. I&rsquo;ll be
glad enough to aid him just to find out what the
mystery is. Evidently it is connected in some
way with Jabez Trask and the old Robertson
mill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The route along the lake shore was a rough one,
but presently they gained a fairly good highway,
and late in the afternoon reached a broad field,
bordered by the lake on one side and by dense
woods on the others.</p>
<p>It was an ideal location for an encampment and
nearly all of the cadets were greatly pleased and
said so. The only ones who did not particularly
like it were Ritter and a few others who were
inclined to be &ldquo;sporty.&rdquo; For them the spot was
too far away from a town or city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stay here or go to one of the
summer hotels for fun,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I
wanted to camp somewhere where we could get
into town now and then on the sly, and play pool
and billiards, and get something to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The field had been staked off into two long
streets, one for Company A and the other for
Company B. Between the two streets was an
opening, and here were erected tents for Captain
Putnam, George Strong, and likewise a shelter
for Major Jack and another officer. At the end
of the streets were the cooking quarters and also a
big tent where mess could be served in wet
weather. In dry weather the cadets got their food
and ate it where they pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The tents in the streets were erected with regularity.
The ground sloped toward the lake, and
ditches were dug around the canvases, to carry
off the water when it rained, so that the tent
floorings might remain dry. Each cadet had a cot
upon which to sleep, and extra clothing was hung
upon the tent-poles or kept in the suit-cases. In
the very center of the encampment a tall pole had
been erected and from this the Stars and Stripes
were already floating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have the time of our lives here,&rdquo;
declared Andy. &ldquo;No lessons to learn, and plenty
of chances to go fishing and swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the food is good,&rdquo; came from Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard tack and black coffee after to-night,&rdquo;
answered Dale, with a wink at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; burst out the lad who loved to eat.
&ldquo;I want something better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you&rsquo;ll get horsefly soup some
days&mdash;when the flies are thick,&rdquo; said Pepper, consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! horsefly soup! Do you want to make me
sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ant cake,&rdquo; added The Imp. &ldquo;I know
you love cake full of ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Pepper, do you want to disgust the lot
of us?&rdquo; cried Fred. &ldquo;I can see the ants already,
crawling up my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I went camping once, up in the Adirondacks,&rdquo;
came from Dale. &ldquo;The ants got so thick they
covered everything we had, and we had to move
in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not be bothered here with ants, or horseflies
either&mdash;I had them all cremated,&rdquo; said
Jack, and this sally brought forth much laughter.</p>
<p>It was late by the time supper was had and the
boys had arranged their sleeping quarters to suit
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any hazing to-night?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; was the answer from the most
of the others. &ldquo;But watch out to-morrow night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED DURING A SWIM</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning camp duty commenced
in earnest and Major Ruddy and his
fellow officers had their hands full. Drill and
inspection were had, following breakfast, and
then the camp was &ldquo;policed,&rdquo; that is, cleaned up.
After that the cadets had two hours in which to
do as they pleased.</p>
<p>Some boats had been sent to the spot by Captain
Putnam, and some of the lads went rowing, while
others went fishing and bathing. Pepper and
his friends preferred a dip into the cool and inviting
waters of the lake and were soon in their
bathing suits, which had been brought along.
Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter went off in a rowboat,
followed by some others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is something like!&rdquo; cried Andy, after
a first plunge into the limpid waters. &ldquo;I am
going to have a dip every day I am here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, unless something happens to prevent
it,&rdquo; returned Fred. He missed the use of his
sloop very much.</p>
<p>The cadets had found a cove where the water
was deep and here they had erected a springboard,
and took turns in diving from this. It was great
sport and for some time George Strong watched
the lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Mr. Strong!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;The
water is fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; answered the teacher, with a
smile. &ldquo;But I may come in some other day. I
like swimming as well as you do.&rdquo; And then he
walked off, to attend to some camp duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a difference between him and old Crabtree!&rdquo;
sighed Dale. &ldquo;If all teachers were like Mr.
Strong we&rsquo;d never have a bit of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But old
Crabtree is the kind that sets your teeth on edge
the minute you rub up against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys spent quite some time diving and
sporting around, and then Fred proposed a race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the rock over yonder and back!&rdquo; he cried,
pointing with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you!&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
prize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brass-bound copy of last year&rsquo;s almanac,&rdquo;
answered Jack, and this caused a general laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Six cadets entered the race, and at a word from
a lad on the shore all struck out sturdily for the
rock that was to be the turning spot of the contest.</p>
<p>At first Pepper was ahead, with Fred second,
but presently Emerald drew to the front, followed
by Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, this won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; cried Jack, good naturedly.
&ldquo;Throw out your anchor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t sthop, so I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; answered
Hogan.</p>
<p>As the six swimmers made the turn at the rock
one after the other, a rowboat shot into view.
It was that containing Reff Ritter and Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Racing, eh?&rdquo; murmured the bully, crossly.
He had not slept well the night before and was
all out of sorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to spoil their fun for &rsquo;em,&rdquo; returned
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can do it,&rdquo; went on the bully,
craftily. &ldquo;They have no right to get in the way
of our boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you wouldn&rsquo;t run &rsquo;em down, would
you?&rdquo; asked his crony, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very hard, Gus&mdash;only enough to break up
their race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; cried Andy, in alarm, as he saw
the rowboat being sent in close to the swimmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo; roared Reff Ritter, ungraciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run us down!&rdquo; called out Fred.
&ldquo;Turn out, Ritter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ritter would not turn out. Instead he sent
the boat closer to shore. All in the water tried to
avoid the craft, some swimming to one side and
others ducking beneath the boat. The race was
completely broken up.</p>
<p>Hogan heard the cries, but he was too anxious
to win the race to pay much attention. Suddenly
the rowboat shot beside him and struck him a
sharp blow in the shoulder. With a gasp the
Irish cadet threw up an arm and then disappeared
from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald is struck!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope he isn&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; added Jack</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his own fault,&rdquo; said Ritter. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t he get out of the way?&rdquo; Now that the
damage was done he was somewhat scared himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your fault, Ritter,&rdquo; answered Dale.</p>
<p>The rowboat drifted over the spot where
Emerald had gone down, and all of the other
cadets looked in that direction. The Irish lad was
nowhere to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s killed!&rdquo; gasped Andy. &ldquo;He got
struck pretty hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; gasped Coulter, and he
went white with fear.</p>
<p>All of the boys in the water swam to the spot,
and presently Jack and Dale caught sight of
Hogan, near the bottom of the lake. They dove
down and brought him up. He was unconscious
and had swallowed considerable water. He could
not aid himself and the others took him ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst trick yet,&rdquo; said Jack, after
Emerald had given a gasp and opened his eyes.
&ldquo;How do you feel, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several seconds before the Irish cadet
could reply. In the meantime, very much disturbed,
Ritter and Coulter had beached their boat
and joined the group surrounding the sufferer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I lost control of the boat at the last
minute,&rdquo; said the bully lamely. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to hit anybody. I was only going to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was done on purpose! I saw it,&rdquo; answered
Andy firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Andy Snow, you say that again and
I&rsquo;ll knock you down!&rdquo; cried Ritter fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got to spell Able first,&rdquo; was the
acrobatic youth&rsquo;s reply, as he doubled up his
fists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whe&mdash;where is that spalpeen, Ritter?&rdquo; came
unsteadily from Hogan. &ldquo;Where is he, I say?&rdquo;
And he staggered to his feet. There was a slight
cut on his neck, from which the blood was flowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But, Emerald,
you had better keep quiet for awhile. We&rsquo;ll
attend to Ritter later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to Ritter and right now!&rdquo; roared
the Irish cadet, and having recovered himself
somewhat he made a sudden leap at the bully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be afther givin&rsquo; ye a dose o&rsquo; your own medicine,
so I will!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>He caught Ritter and in his fury shook the
bully as a dog shakes a rat. Then he commenced
to back Ritter to the lake front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, let up!&rdquo; roared the other. &ldquo;It was only
done in fun, I tell you, Hogan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin lit this be fun too,&rdquo; was the Irish cadet&rsquo;s
answer, and of a sudden he gave Ritter a shove
in the breast that sent the bully over backwards
with a splash into the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves Ritter right,&rdquo; murmured Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now fer you, me little goslin!&rdquo; went on
Hogan and leaped for Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le-let me alone&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to touch
you!&rdquo; whined Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;You backed up Ritter&mdash;an&rsquo; ye can cool off wid
him, too,&rdquo; answered Hogan, and catching Coulter
by the neck and the seat of his trousers, he ran
him down to the lake after Ritter and pitched him
in. Coulter landed on top of his crony, and both
went out of sight with a great splash. Then
Hogan shoved from the shore the rowboat Ritter
and Coulter had been using.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You git into that, an&rsquo; be off wid yez!&rdquo; roared
the Irish cadet, when Ritter and Coulter reappeared
in the water. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yez dare to land
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much alarmed at Hogan&rsquo;s sudden fury, the
bully and his crony kept away from the shore.
They swam to the rowboat and clambered on
board. Then, dripping from head to feet, they
picked up their floating caps, and took up the
oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re smart, but I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;
cried Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis your own fault,&rdquo; answered Emerald.
&ldquo;Supposin&rsquo; I had been drowned, what thin, eh?
Bad cess to you, Ritter! You&rsquo;re a bad egg, if iver
there was wan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the bully did not dare make answer, and
he and his crony rowed off. They went to a
secluded but sunny spot up the lake, and there
dried themselves as best they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you not to do it,&rdquo; whined Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dry up, you make me tired,&rdquo; answered
Ritter, and for the remainder of the day he and
Coulter had little to do with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so wet?&rdquo; asked Paxton, when
the pair went back to the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we got into a mix-up with some of the
cadets and fell overboard,&rdquo; answered Ritter, in an
off-handed manner. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he
added, quickly, to avoid giving further particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went up to the head of the lake,&rdquo; answered
Paxton. &ldquo;And say, I and Mumps made a discovery,&rdquo;
he added. Mumps was, as my old
readers know, a small cadet whose real name was
John Fenwick. He was a good deal of a sneak
and continually toadying to those bigger than
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you discover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found a good big hornets&rsquo; nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that&rsquo;s of no account,&rdquo; was Coulter&rsquo;s
comment</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it though! That&rsquo;s all you know about
it,&rdquo; cried Paxton. &ldquo;I once found a hornets&rsquo; nest
and put a big flour bag over it and took it down
and brought it to school and had dead loads of fun
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, can you handle &rsquo;em that way?&rdquo; queried
Ritter, with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but you have to be awfully careful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, it would be a scheme to secure the nest
and introduce some of our enemies to the
hornets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking,&rdquo; said Nick Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you get the nest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best time is at night, when the hornets are
all inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want a good, heavy bag, otherwise the
hornets will get out and sting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make a bag, of paper and paste,&rdquo; said
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep it quiet and we&rsquo;ll see what we can
do with the nest&mdash;after we have it,&rdquo; answered Reff
Ritter. &ldquo;I think I know of a scheme,&rdquo; he
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the cadet who had made the
find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later the Ruddy crowd will have
some kind of a feast. When they get together we
can watch our chance and throw the hornets&rsquo; nest
in their midst. I reckon that will wake &rsquo;em up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure will,&rdquo; said Paxton with a chuckle, and
even Coulter had to smile over the prospect of
doing such a thing to the enemy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while this talk was going on,
Jack and Andy were walking in the woods back of
the encampment. Presently they fell in with
Mumps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mumps!&rdquo; cried the young major pleasantly.
&ldquo;Walking out for your health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been up the lake with Paxton,&rdquo;
answered the little sneak. He liked to be noticed
by such a superior as the major of the battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you see anything worth seeing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of things. Saw a hornets&rsquo; nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall into it?&rdquo; asked Pepper. &ldquo;If you did I
guess you got out in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t fall into it. Paxton and I found
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you threw stones at it,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t touch it. I wanted to throw a
stone but Paxton wouldn&rsquo;t let me. He said&mdash;But
never mind that now,&rdquo; added the sneak hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say, Mumps?&rdquo; demanded Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you want to know, he said he
might come and get the hornets&rsquo; nest some time
and play a joke on some of the cadets with it. I
guess he wants to get square with some of the
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, I see,&rdquo; mused Jack, and he and Pepper
looked knowingly at each other. &ldquo;Where was the
hornets&rsquo; nest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Paxton said I wasn&rsquo;t to tell anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me, Mumps, and I&rsquo;ll give you my old
baseball,&rdquo; said Pepper. He chanced to know that
the sneak wanted a ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, but you musn&rsquo;t tell Paxton
I did so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; said The Imp. And
thereupon the sneak took him and the young major
to where the hornets&rsquo; nest was located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the ball to-morrow,&rdquo; said Pepper,
on the way back to the camp. &ldquo;Now, mum&rsquo;s the
word all around remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anybody I told you,&rdquo; answered
Mumps.</p>

<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">HAZING A BULLY</span></h2>
<p>Pepper and Andy slept close together in one of
the tents. That night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, each
was rudely awakened by having the cot upon which
he rested tipped up on one side. Both rolled to
the floor and bumped into one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hazing!&rdquo; returned Pepper. &ldquo;Will you
kindly take your head out of my stomach,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; asked Andy, as he struggled to
get up, a blanket having become twisted about
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;excepting it may be the Reff
Ritter crowd,&rdquo; returned Pepper, rubbing his nose,
which had been bumped on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Cries came from the tent adjoining, and the
two boys soon discovered that the cots of a dozen
cadets had been turned over. One sufferer&rsquo;s nose
was bleeding, and all of the crowd were more or
less angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Ritter!&rdquo; cried one cadet. &ldquo;I saw him
just as he dodged around a corner of the tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it you were awake?&rdquo; asked another
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just came in from guard duty. I was on
Post 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it was the Ritter crowd we ought to
get after &rsquo;em,&rdquo; came from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be the Ritter crowd?&rdquo; came from
another cadet. &ldquo;I heard they were going to have a
feast to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That comes off to-morrow night,&rdquo; answered Joe
Nelson.</p>
<p>As quietly as possible, so as not to disturb
Captain Putnam and George Strong, the cadets
looked around the various tents of their enemies.
They found Ritter in his tent, lying on his cot and
snoring loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is shamming,&rdquo; whispered Pepper. &ldquo;Just
wait till I prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you do it?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some red ink in a bottle here. I&rsquo;ll
daub his face with that. It&rsquo;s indelible and it won&rsquo;t
come off for a month. He&rsquo;ll look like an Indian
on the warpath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The Imp spoke in a whisper and on tiptoes he
approached Reff Ritter. As he bent over the
bully the latter sat up very suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me alone!&rdquo; he blustered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
dare to daub me with your red ink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! so you are wideawake, just as I suspected,&rdquo;
cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you touch me with that red ink, Pepper
Ditmore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red ink?&rdquo; questioned The Imp, innocently.
&ldquo;Who mentioned red ink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did&mdash;but you&rsquo;re not going to put any on
me! I&rsquo;ll report you if you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be dreaming, Ritter. I haven&rsquo;t any
red ink. I just came in to see if you were awake.
Do you usually snore so loudly when you aren&rsquo;t
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! think you&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was shamming true enough!&rdquo; cried Andy.
&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he went on, addressing his friends. &ldquo;I
move we initiate Ritter into the mysteries of a
trip on an airship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airship?&rdquo; said the bully. &ldquo;Who has an airship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried several who understood
Andy&rsquo;s allusion to an &ldquo;airship.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him
his first lesson now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>In a twinkling Reff Ritter was surrounded and
bundled up in his own blanket. Then he was
lifted bodily from the cot and taken out of the
tent through the back. Six cadets carried him
across the field.</p>
<p>Some cadets were still on guard and how to get
out of camp was a problem. But Dale solved
that question with ease. He gave a low whistle
and one of the guards answered it almost instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go past Post No. 7,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;The guard
there will be looking at the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others followed his advice. On Post No. 7
Fred Century was stationed. They saw him looking
intently up at a bright star, evidently
oblivious to his surroundings and, of course, he
did not see or notice them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Fred!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;He knows
his little book all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the end of the encampment field, the
cadets entered the edge of the woods. Here was a
swing which some of the boys had put up the
afternoon before.</p>
<p>The rope of the swing was speedily secured, and
several cadet belts were placed around Ritter&rsquo;s
waist and under his arms. Then the rope was
run under these belts and the other end was thrown
over the limb of a big tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now up with him!&rdquo; ordered Andy. &ldquo;Ritter,
you&rsquo;ll soon know how it feels to fly through the
air!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The cadets pulled on the rope with a will and
up into the air went Ritter, sprawling out like
a frog and turning around and around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted one of the cadets. &ldquo;Reff,
how do you enjoy flying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but he cuts a pretty figure!&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just move your arms and you&rsquo;ll think you
are flying sure,&rdquo; came from a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you let me down!&rdquo; growled the bully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun to have these belts cutting you. I&rsquo;m
getting dizzy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can stay there until sunrise!&rdquo;
answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunrise! Not much! You let me down!&rdquo;
howled Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you down if you&rsquo;ll apologize for
dumping us out of bed and if you&rsquo;ll promise not
to do it again,&rdquo; said Andy. Nobody had any intention
of leaving Ritter suspended in mid-air
for any great length of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll apologize to nobody!&rdquo; cried the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let him hang,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Come on
back, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a move as if to leave the spot and his
chums did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, come back! Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; yelled
Ritter, in sudden horror. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it! Let
me down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you apologize?&rdquo; demanded several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to. But this ain&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you apologize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the low answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you promise not to do such a thing
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, anything you want,&mdash;only let me
down,&rdquo; growled Ritter.</p>
<p>The bully was lowered and the rope and belts
were loosened. He was a little dizzy, and sank
down on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&mdash;give me air!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>The other cadets fell back, so that he might
have all the air he desired. This was the chance
the bully wanted and with a bound he arose and
commenced to run for camp with all the speed he
could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal of the guard!&rdquo; he yelled, as he
dodged past one of the cadets on guard. &ldquo;Thieves!
Robbers! Help!&rdquo; he went on, and then he dodged
into his tent and threw himself on his cot, pretending
to be asleep as before.</p>
<p>The loud alarm woke the entire camp, just as
the bully had desired, and Captain Putnam came
rushing from his tent, followed by George Strong.
Then Major Jack appeared and so did Captain
Bart Conners and Captain Henry Lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; answered Major Jack, but
he suspected that some of the cadets were out for
a lark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go the rounds of the guards and find out,&rdquo;
went on the master of the school shortly. He was
determined to break up the horseplay if it could
possibly be accomplished.</p>
<p>In the meantime Andy, Pepper and the others
had not yet gotten into camp. They had to put
the swing rope away and distribute the belts, and
the sudden alarm given by Ritter had taken them
all unawares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, we are going to have a tight
squeeze of it getting in,&rdquo; said Pepper, as the alarm
increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Ritter would be mean enough
to raise such a hullabaloo,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t
take a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sour on our crowd and will do all in his
power to get us into trouble,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get past Fred again, for there is
Captain Putnam making straight for that post!&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down to the lake front,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;But be quick. They may call the roll!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The cadets skirted the woods on the double-quick
and came down to the water&rsquo;s edge. Here,
to their relief, they found Hogan on guard. Hale
gave a low whistle, to which the Irish cadet responded.
Then up into the air went Emerald&rsquo;s
face and he commenced to study the stars, utterly
oblivious to his surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our chance!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and past
the guard they sped, Hogan paying not the slightest
attention to them. After they had passed Dale
whistled once more, and the Irish cadet withdrew
his gaze from the stars and resumed his march
to the end of his post</p>
<p>Scarcely had the boys gotten into camp when
the drum rolled out sharply. Wondering what
was wrong, those who had been sleeping soundly
got up and hurried to the parade ground. Lanterns
and torches were lit, and the two companies
lined up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the roll called, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Note carefully the names of
all those who do not answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sir,&rdquo; answered the young officer, and he
wondered how many of his chums would prove to
be missing.</p>
<p>Pepper dropped into line yawning broadly, as
if just aroused from a heavy sleep, and Andy and
the others followed suit, Dale stretching himself
as if he could not get awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they let a fellow sleep?&rdquo; grumbled
The Imp, and this almost set some of the others
to laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; said Andy in a low voice. &ldquo;I want
to keep a straight face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we all get here?&rdquo; asked another anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calling of the roll commenced, and one
after another the cadets answered their names.
The roll was called by the quartermaster, but
George Strong had another roll on which he did
the checking, so that Bob might make no mistake or
check off some friend who did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven cadets missing,&rdquo; announced George
Strong after the roll call had come to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight of those are on guard duty,&rdquo; answered
Major Jack, and had the corporal of the guard
give the names. He was wondering who the three
other cadets could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That leaves three to account for,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Strong consulted his roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicholas Paxton, William Sabine and Frank
Barringer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Barringer had permission to go away&mdash;his
folks are at the Lake Hotel,&rdquo; answered the master
of the school. He raised his voice: &ldquo;Does anybody
know anything about Paxton and Sabine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take a look around the camp and see
if we can find them,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>This was done but the two cadets could not be
found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton said after supper he didn&rsquo;t feel very
well,&rdquo; said Coulter, lamely. &ldquo;Maybe he left the
camp to look for a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, but I doubt it,&rdquo; answered Captain
Putnam, dryly.</p>
<p>The cadets were dismissed and told to keep
absolutely quiet for the remainder of the night.
As they returned to their tents speculation was
rife concerning the two missing cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they slipped off to one of the lake hotels
they will be punished for it,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton is getting quite sporty,&rdquo; answered
another cadet. &ldquo;And poor Billy Sabine is just
foolish enough to follow his example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for Billy,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;He is a
pretty decent sort sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets retired and for about an hour
matters in camp were quiet. Then, from the
woods, came several screams of terror. A rifle
shot rang out, and once more the camp was in an
uproar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">A GAME OF BASEBALL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did somebody get shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this night is the worst yet! Why can&rsquo;t
they let a fellow sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going to keep on like this we better go
back to the Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the talk ran on, as the cadets rushed out on
the parade ground to learn the cause of the new
disturbance.</p>
<p>Those to make first appearance beheld Nick
Paxton and Billy Sabine running as if some
demon was after them. Both were out of breath
and shaking with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; screamed Billy Sabine, and ran to
Captain Putnam and clutched him by the arm
frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Sabine?&rdquo; asked the master
of the school anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost&mdash;a madman, a monster!&rdquo; gasped
Sabine. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let him touch me, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo; queried Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was worse than a ghost,&rdquo; came from Paxton,
when he was able to speak. &ldquo;Oh, I hope it doesn&rsquo;t
come this way!&rdquo; And he glanced over his
shoulder apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nonsense, boys! There are no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fired that shot?&rdquo; asked George Strong,
while a crowd of cadets gathered around to learn
what the new alarm meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said a guard named Leeks. &ldquo;I called
on those fellows to halt, but they didn&rsquo;t, so I fired
to arouse the corporal of the guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was quite right, Leeks,&rdquo; returned the
master of the school. He turned again to Paxton
and Sabine. &ldquo;Now, give me your stories. Where
have you been? You had no permission to leave
the grounds. We missed you an hour or more
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Paxton and Sabine hung their
heads. Sabine looked thoroughly miserable. As
my old readers know, he was not naturally bad
but was a lad easily led into wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot you answer me?&rdquo; demanded the master
of the school, after a painful pause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton got me to go to a hotel down the lake
shore, sir,&rdquo; said Sabine in a low tone. &ldquo;I am
very sorry I went, sir, and I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive
me, sir. I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo; And he gazed
pleadingly at Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this, Paxton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I went to the hotel because I thought
some of my friends were stopping there,&rdquo; was the
lame reply. &ldquo;As soon as I&mdash;er&mdash;found my
friends weren&rsquo;t there I came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you usually make calls after midnight?&rdquo;
demanded the master of the school, with fine
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know it was so late, sir. But
we would have been back long ago if it wasn&rsquo;t for
that&mdash;er&mdash;ghost, or worse!&rdquo; continued Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see? Now no fooling, Paxton,
or it will go hard with you,&rdquo; and Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
voice grew extra stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a ghost, or demon, or something, sir.
It was horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most frightful thing one could possibly
imagine,&rdquo; broke in Sabine, and his voice commenced
to tremble again. &ldquo;Oh, Captain Putnam,
you may not believe it, but it was awful, sir,
awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was it?&rdquo; persisted the master of the
school, seeing how much in earnest both cadets
were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was like a half-man and a half-beast,&rdquo;
answered Paxton. &ldquo;It was very large and had a
terrible voice. It chased us with a stick that was
full of flashes of fire, and both of us thought we
were going to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a trick of some of the cadets,&rdquo; suggested
George Strong.</p>
<p>At this suggestion Paxton and Sabine looked
up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, could it have been some of the cadets?&rdquo;
questioned Sabine. &ldquo;But no, it couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;it
was too awful!&rdquo; And he shook his head positively.
Evidently he had been almost frightened
out of his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cadets have all been accounted for,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of them are
responsible for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did this happen, over in yonder
woods?&rdquo; questioned George Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back of the woods, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back of the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, near the falls. There is an old mill
up there. We were coming along the mill road
when all of a sudden the Thing, whatever it was,
rushed at us. We ran and it came after us! Oh,
I thought my last moment on earth had come!&rdquo;
gasped Sabine, shaking afresh over the recollection
of what had occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange, to say the least,&rdquo; mused the
master of the school. &ldquo;How did it look to you,
Paxton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you any more than I have, sir,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;It was ghostlike and half-man
and half-beast, and it had a loud voice and that
stick of fire. It came at us so&mdash;so ferociously that
we had to run for fear of being killed on the
spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all either Paxton or Sabine could tell.
They stuck to their tale so persistently that Captain
Putnam felt compelled to believe them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll investigate in the morning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It
is probably some trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was played by some of the Pornell
students,&rdquo; suggested Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. Now go to bed, all of you, and let
me hear no more alarms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the cadets retired. Pepper walked
off with Jack and Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, what do you make of this?&rdquo; asked
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was some trick,&rdquo; answered the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you hear what they said&mdash;that it
happened near that old mill, the Robertson mill?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; mused Jack. &ldquo;The place that
Bert Field was asking about, and the spot some
claim is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Pornell fellows would play
that trick,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare&mdash;so
close on their other doings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to investigate this on my own account,&rdquo;
continued Pepper. &ldquo;I am very curious
to visit that haunted mill, and I am curious to
know why Bert Field is interested in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may get a chance some day,&rdquo;
answered Jack; and there the talk had to come to
an end.</p>
<p>In the morning the majority of the cadets were
sleepy and inclined to lay around after inspection
and breakfast and take it easy. Paxton and
Sabine were again questioned, and Captain Putnam
departed on horseback, to investigate their
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if it was going to rain,&rdquo; said Andy,
and he was right, and soon the drops commenced
to fall. It was a steady downpour, lasting until
the middle of the afternoon and the boys were
glad enough to keep under shelter, only the guards
being out, wearing their rubber coats.</p>
<p>In the midst of the storm Captain Putnam
came back. He held a long talk with George
Strong and then called in Paxton and Sabine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what scared you,&rdquo; said the
master of the school. &ldquo;I rode around the old mill
and found it locked and nailed up and nobody in
sight. As you were badly frightened I will not
punish you for leaving the camp without permission.
But do not do it again, or I will punish
you severely.&rdquo; And there the matter rested.</p>
<p>The rain put a damper on the enthusiasm of
the cadets and a few wished they were back at the
Hall. But by nightfall it cleared off, and great
campfires were kindled, so that things might be
dried out, and then everybody felt better.</p>
<p>On Saturday it had been arranged that a game
of baseball should come off, between nines of
Company A and Company B. The rivalry between
the nines was intense and much interest
was manifested as a consequence.</p>
<p>Company A had for its pitcher Reff Ritter.
Ritter had not been chosen for his popularity but
because he knew how to pitch and had lately been
doing good work in the box. For a catcher Ritter
had Coulter, and two of his other cronies were in
the field.</p>
<p>Dale was the pitcher for Company B, and
Stuffer was catcher. On this nine, Andy was
shortstop and Pepper covered second. These were
not the positions the lads had previously filled,
but Captain Putnam insisted that some changes
be made, so that other lads might have a chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>To make matters more interesting it was
announced that visitors would be welcome to the
camp during the game and afterwards, and Jack,
who did not play, quickly invited the Fords to
attend. A little stand was erected, so that the
visitors might have seats.</p>
<p>Mr. Rossmore Ford came up the lake road in
a big tallyho, bringing with him his wife, his two
daughters, and half a dozen other people. Others
arrived in carriages, on bicycles and on foot, until
the visitors numbered fully a hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope Pepper and Andy&rsquo;s side win!&rdquo; cried
Laura Ford, enthusiastically, after she had looked
over the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think Company B has as good a show
as Company A,&rdquo; answered Jack, with a smile.</p>
<p>A professional ball player who chanced to be
stopping at one of the lake hotels had consented
to be umpire, and promptly at three o&rsquo;clock he
called out &ldquo;Play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Company A was first at the bat, with their best
men heading the list, and when they retired they
had scored two runs. This made their supporters
enthusiastic and they were loudly applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now show &rsquo;em what you can do!&rdquo; cried a
cadet, as Company B came up to the home plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter will strike &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The first man up was struck out and the second
followed. Then came a pop fly, which was easily
gathered in, and Company B retired with the score
2 to 0 against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks bad,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But the game is
young yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the second inning Company A managed to
get one more run and in the third they brought
their score up to seven runs. Company B scored
three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a brace, boys!&rdquo; cried Jack, to Pepper
and Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My arm was a little stiff at the start, from
getting wet during the storm,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;But
it is limbering up now.&rdquo; And this proved to be
true, and in the next inning he struck out three
men in succession, amid great applause.</p>
<p>When Company B came to the bat Pepper
knocked a home run and Andy a three-bagger.
But that ended the run getting for the time being.</p>
<p>The beginning of the eighth inning found the
score 11 to 7 in favor of Company A. Ritter and
his followers were in high feather, thinking they
were sure of winning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe we won&rsquo;t celebrate to-night,&rdquo;
chuckled the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rub the defeat in good while you are at it,&rdquo;
said Paxton, who was on the substitute bench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we will!&rdquo; answered Ritter boastfully.</p>
<p>Ritter was to the bat and managed to line out
a safety. He was followed by a player who went
out on a foul, but the next man knocked a two-bagger
and Ritter managed to slide home, amid
well-deserved applause. When Company A retired
they had 14 runs to their credit.</p>
<p>Dale was now to the bat and managed to get to
second in safety. Pepper got to first and a wild
throw over the baseman&rsquo;s head gave Dale third
and Pepper second. Then came a streak of good
batting and the end of the eighth inning found
Company B with 11 runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hold &rsquo;em down!&rdquo; said Pepper, as
Company A came up for the ninth time to the
bat. &ldquo;Dale, do your best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pitcher tried to steady himself and struck
out the first man up. The second went to first on
balls and the next batter hit a safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Dale, steady!&rdquo; cried Jack. And Dale
settled down to even work once more, and Company
A retired with only its 14 runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our last chance to win!&rdquo; cried Pepper, as his
side came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered the young major,
anxiously. &ldquo;Three runs to tie the score and four
to win!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">IN DANGER OF FIRE</span></h2>
<p>Ritter had a smile of confidence on his face
and he walked down to the pitcher&rsquo;s box with
something of a swagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike the three of &rsquo;em out, Reff!&rdquo; shouted one
of the bully&rsquo;s supporters. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em see what
first looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of &rsquo;em, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; answered
Ritter.</p>
<p>A cadet named Jackson was first to the bat.
He was not an extra good hitter and now he was
nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; was the umpire&rsquo;s cry as the first
ball pitched whizzed over the plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it, Reff!&rdquo; came the cry
from one of the bully&rsquo;s cronies.</p>
<p>The next was a ball, but then came two strikes,
and much crestfallen Jackson retired, while the
supporters of Company A cheered Ritter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Dale came to the bat next and had one strike
called on him. Then he hit out a safety and got
to first with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Now keep up the good work!&rdquo; cried
a supporter of Company B.</p>
<p>As before, Pepper followed Dale. He watched
the ball closely, and had two balls called on him
and a strike. Then he got just what he wanted
and lined out a beautiful two-bagger. Dale was
on the alert and by the time Pepper got safely on
second he slid home, amid a wild cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got Ritter going! Keep up the good
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but wasn&rsquo;t that a beaut of a two base
hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy was now at the bat. Plainly Ritter was
getting nervous and soon he had two balls called
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him walk&mdash;make him hit it!&rdquo; was
the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix him!&rdquo; muttered the bully sourly, and
then sent in a ball directly over the plate.</p>
<p>Andy was there to meet it, and the way he lined
the sphere down to left field was a sight to behold.
Down he pounded for first while Pepper legged it
for all he was worth for home. The ball came in,
but too late and while Pepper was called safe
Andy managed to slide to second amid a renewed
cheering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen to fourteen!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;And
only one man out! Now is your chance to tie the
score!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter walked down to the pitcher&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool, Reff,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
them rattle you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not rattling me,&rdquo; was the dogged
answer. But the very tone of his voice showed the
bully&rsquo;s nervousness.</p>
<p>Stuffer was now up and he, too, was nervous.
He watched the pitcher as a cat watches a mouse.
Ritter sent in a ball that was remarkably swift.
It came directly for Stuffer&rsquo;s head and he had
barely time to pull back out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo; cried the umpire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what do you want to do, kill me?&rdquo; cried
Stuffer angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;the ball slipped,&rdquo; answered Ritter
lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat it down to the woods, Stuffer!&rdquo; cried one
of the supporters of Company B.</p>
<p>Following the ball came two strikes and the
supporters of Company B grew sober, thinking
Stuffer would strike out. But then the lad who
loved to eat hit the sphere fairly, sending it just
over the second baseman&rsquo;s head. He gained first
while Andy, who had stolen to third, came in amid
a cheering that was deafening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tie! A tie! The score is a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart Conners, the captain of Company B, was
now to the bat. Bart was a better military officer
than a baseball player, yet he resolved to do his
best for his command. He bunted the ball, reaching
first on a fumble by Coulter, while Stuffer got
down to second.</p>
<p>Conners was followed by Fred who, so far, had
done but little to aid Company B to win the match.
Fred had two strikes called on him, and it looked
as if he would be put out when he met the sphere
fairly and squarely and sent it far down into the
center field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run! Run! Everybody run!&rdquo; was the cry,
and amid great excitement Stuffer ran in, followed
by Bart. Fred got to third and might have
reached home but Ritter got in his way, sending
him flat on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two runs! Company B wins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but that was a dandy hit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter got in his way on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything of the kind!&rdquo; growled the
pitcher. &ldquo;If anybody says I did I&rsquo;ll punch his
head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Fred?&rdquo; asked Jack, running to
his chum&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo; was Fred&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;But he
bumped into me pretty lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lively discussion followed, and in his rage
Reff Ritter threw the ball on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all down on me&mdash;I won&rsquo;t pitch any
more,&rdquo; he growled, and started to walk from the
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;We have
won the game anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;No use of playing
it out. Company B wins by the score of 16
to 14,&mdash;with only one man out in the ninth.&rdquo;
And so the game came to an end. Some wanted
Ritter to pitch the inning out but he positively
would not, and nobody cared to take his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a great game!&rdquo; declared Jack.
&ldquo;I never was so interested before in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed it very much,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;I am
glad Company B won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Ritter seems to be an ugly sort,&rdquo; was Mr.
Ford&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is&mdash;especially when he cannot have his
own way,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Following the baseball game came some athletic
contests, such as high jumping and hurdling. In
the hurdling Emerald Hogan carried off the
honors and was greatly applauded. The high
jumping contest was won by Henry Lee, who was
quiet but a great favorite. One of the girls present
presented Henry with a big bouquet, which made
the athlete blush deeply.</p>
<p>The guests who had been especially invited by
Captain Putnam and the cadets to the contests
were also asked to remain to a collation. Cake
and ice-cream had been brought from one of the
summer hotels down the lake shore, and these were
served, with lemonade, by the boys. Jack and his
chums found seats under an awning for the Fords
and did all they could to make the girls comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be jolly to camp out!&rdquo; declared
Flossie. &ldquo;Papa, we must try it some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fine&mdash;when it doesn&rsquo;t rain,&rdquo; answered
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the mosquitoes don&rsquo;t get too lively,&rdquo; added
Pepper, and at this there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>The only cadets who did not enter into the spirit
of the celebration were Reff Ritter and his cronies.
Ritter did not wait for cake and ice-cream, but
walked away into the woods, taking Coulter,
Paxton and Billy Sabine with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me sick&mdash;the way the other crowd
crow!&rdquo; declared the defeated pitcher. &ldquo;They won
by a fluke, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared Coulter, who had
made several bad errors behind the bat. &ldquo;But
just wait, we&rsquo;ll wax &rsquo;em next time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what about that hornets&rsquo; nest?&rdquo; asked
Sabine. &ldquo;Thought you fellows said something
about using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will&mdash;but there is no hurry,&rdquo; answered
Ritter. &ldquo;Just wait till some night when the
Ruddy crowd have a celebration&mdash;we&rsquo;ll make it
lively for &rsquo;em!&rdquo; And he laughed coarsely.</p>
<p>By nightfall the festivities came to an end and
the visitors departed for home. Some of the boys
wanted to build a big bonfire, to celebrate the baseball
victory during the evening, but Captain
Putnam would not allow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind is rising and it is very shifty,&rdquo; said
the master of the school. &ldquo;If the fire got to blowing
among the tents we might have trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think the fire would hurt anything,&rdquo;
grumbled Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never can tell,&rdquo; answered Fred.
Some wood had been gathered for the fire by
Dale, Pepper, Andy and Fred, and the quartet
were much disappointed when they found they
could not start the blaze. Fred had thought to
start the fire in a new way&mdash;by putting some
carbide from a bicycle lamp on the ground in a
little water and then igniting the gas formed by
the combination. He forgot to put the carbide
holder away, leaving it on the pile of wood.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam was right about the wind, it
was steadily rising and blowing first from one
direction and then another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have your men peg down the tents good and
tight,&rdquo; said the captain to Major Jack, and the
young commander of the battalion at once issued
the necessary orders.</p>
<p>By bedtime the wind was blowing almost a gale.
Then, however, it appeared to die down. The
guards were set as usual. Reff Ritter was
stationed on Post 3, while Sabine was on Post 2.
At the other end of that side of the encampment,
on Post 4, was a cadet named Mason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a raw night to be out,&rdquo; grumbled Ritter to
Sabine, when the two met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to
get under the covers when my time is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll smoke a cigarette,&rdquo; went on Reff
Ritter, looking around to see if anybody was in
that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anybody catch you at it,&rdquo; said
Sabine, who well knew that cigarette smoking was
against the rules.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Ritter got out a cigarette and, not without
difficulty, lit it. He took several puffs and inhaled
the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have one,&rdquo; he said, and passed over the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will,&rdquo; answered Billy Sabine
weakly. He did not wish to smoke, but he did
not want to look like a coward.</p>
<p>The boys were at the end of the woods and
remained together for several minutes. Then
each walked off along his post The wind was now
coming up again, and presently a sudden gust took
Ritter&rsquo;s cigarette from his fingers. It struck a
nearby bush and the burning tobacco was carried
through the air a distance of a hundred feet or
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the cadet named
Mason, as he came to a halt at the end of Post 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; grumbled Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I saw some fire flying through the
air. Well, I declare! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason stared in wonder in the direction of
where the wood had been heaped up for the bonfire.
The burning tobacco had been carried by
the wind to this heap and had landed on the box
of carbide. A few drops of rain were coming
down, and the carbide was commencing to blaze
up like a gasolene torch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; cried Ritter and running
forward he kicked at the brushwood in semi-darkness.
Over went the can of carbide into a pool
of water. At once came a flash of fire from the
gas thus generated, and the brushwood commenced
to blaze away at a lively rate.</p>
<p>It was now raining lightly and the wind was
blowing stronger and stronger. Ritter tried to
put out the fire, but it roared louder and louder,
as more gas from the carbide was generated, and
he grew afraid and drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Century had that carbide,&rdquo; said Mason.
&ldquo;I saw him with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he had it,&rdquo; added Ritter quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
his fault that the brushwood took fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t set it on fire, Reff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t anywhere around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! He might have put a slow match
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he did that? I saw some fire
in the air&mdash;but I thought it came from this
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you keep quiet about this,&mdash;or we&rsquo;ll
both get into trouble!&rdquo; answered Ritter. And
just then the wind came up with a sudden fury,
sending the burning brush rolling directly towards
the tents of the encampment!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE INVESTIGATION</span></h2>
<p>There was very little rain, but the wind was
heavy and increasing constantly. It sent the burning
brands from the brushwood directly between
the tents of Company A and Company B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo; was the cry, as several cadets on
guard duty saw the danger, and then one in his
excitement fired his gun.</p>
<p>The shot brought the corporal of the guard to
the scene, and in a moment a general alarm arose.
The wind was now humming and whistling
throughout the encampment and the burning
brands were rolled first in one direction and then
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp is burning up!&rdquo; yelled Mumps, as
he came from his tent. &ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo;
And he rushed towards the lake, with the idea
of leaping into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>When Pepper came from his tent a burning
brand, flying through the air, hit his cheek. One
also struck Jack. The wind was now so fierce
that the cadets could scarcely stand up, and some
of the tents were swaying and bulging dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out!&rdquo; called Captain Putnam, after a
glance at the situation. &ldquo;Company A, mind the
tents and keep them from blowing away. Company
B, see if you can secure the burning wood
and throw it into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the cadets ran to execute the orders.
One tent was down and it fell directly on some
of the burning wood, adding to the flames.
Another tent went down on top of three cadets,
and it was with difficulty that the lads were
rescued from the wreckage. One had his shoulder
twisted, but in the general excitement this was
scarcely noticed.</p>
<p>But if Company A had its hands full saving
the tents, Company B had even more strenuous
labor fighting the flames. In such a high wind it
was dangerous to go anywhere near the burning
and flying brushwood and more than one lad had
his hands and face blistered, trying to throw or
haul the fiery stuff to the lake. Some of the
cadets got rakes, used in policing the camp, and
with these the bigger brands were pulled to the
water and submerged.
<a href="#front" id="rfront">The fire seemed to be everywhere</a>,
and the boys did not know where to
fight it first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;The camp is doomed!&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Wonder
what started it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out later,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;I am
glad now that we didn&rsquo;t light the bonfire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Putnam and George Strong joined the
ranks of the fire fighters and directed the work.
Yet little headway was made until there came a
lull in the wind. Then, as quickly as possible,
most of the burning brush was hurried to the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wet some horse-blankets and beat the
fire out that way,&rdquo; said George Strong, and this
order was carried out, and before the wind again
arose all in the camp were glad to know that the
conflagration was under control.</p>
<p>That night was one destined never to be forgotten
by either Captain Putnam or those under
him. With the danger from the fire past, the
danger from the wind storm increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular tornado!&rdquo; said Jack to George
Strong, as both did what they could to hold down
the big tent in the midst of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, Major Ruddy, but it is a pretty stiff
gale,&rdquo; answered the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will keep up all night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may. But if it does I am afraid half of
the tents will be down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, three of &rsquo;em are down already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst wind we have had in some
time. I did not look for such a blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour the wind kept up, only dying
down for a minute or two. It was useless to
attempt to peg down the tents when they once got
loose and they were allowed to remain flat, and
some cots were placed on top, to keep them from
blowing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst yet!&rdquo; grumbled Stuffer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
give as much as a dollar to be back in my bed at
the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the fun of a soldier&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to join the regular
army, Stuffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night!&rdquo; was the quick answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind is going down a little,&rdquo; announced
Andy, some time later. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll have a
quiet Sunday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By two o&rsquo;clock in the morning the wind had
died down to a gentle breeze. Lanterns were lit
and an inspection of the wreck was begun. Five
tent poles had been shattered, three tents had been
torn, and two tents had had good sized holes burnt
in them. Among the cadets seven or eight had
burnt blisters on their hands and faces and, one
boy had his shoulder wrenched and another had
twisted his ankle. Fortunately, however, none
of the hurts were serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Extra tents were to be had from one of the
wagons, and these were set up in place of those
torn and burnt. Then the other tents were again
fastened down, and the cots were readjusted. It
was some time before the cadets had retired, for
the excitement served to keep them awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be an investigation of this,&rdquo; said
Andy to Pepper. &ldquo;Whoever started that bonfire
had no right to do so, for it was against Captain
Putnam&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Fred started it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says not, and I believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday morning found the storm cleared away
and the sun shining brightly. When the cadets
got up they were sleepy, and consequently Captain
Putnam had roll call and breakfast delayed.
Then came chapel service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to-day is Sunday I shall not inquire into
the cause that led to the fire last night,&rdquo; said the
master of the school, when the cadets had
assembled. &ldquo;But an investigation will be made
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement was received with interest,
and during the remainder of the day the cadets
discussed the matter freely among themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;You keep quiet about our smoking,&rdquo; said
Ritter to Sabine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t start the fire,&rdquo; faltered Sabine.
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I put out my cigarette as soon as you left
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to shove this thing off on me!&rdquo;
said the bully fiercely. &ldquo;You are as much to
blame as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark fairly terrorized the weak-kneed
cadet and he promised not to say a word about
smoking.</p>
<p>The investigation was started directly after
breakfast on Monday morning. The entire school
was assembled for the purpose and Captain Putnam
showed that he meant to get at the bottom of
the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire was kindled against my express orders,&rdquo;
said the master of the school. &ldquo;I knew a storm
was coming but I must confess I did not think it
would blow quite so strongly. It was Providence
that kept the entire camp from burning down.
Dale Blackmore, come forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this command Dale stepped to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You assisted in gathering the wood for that
bonfire, did you not?&rdquo; asked the master of the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did sir,&rdquo; answered Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else assisted at this work?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, do you expect me to tell on
the other cadets?&rdquo; demanded Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmore, this is a serious piece of business.
The whole camp might have burnt up and some of
the cadets with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t start the fire, and I don&rsquo;t know who
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gathered the wood beside yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, for one!&rdquo; said Pepper, coming forward
a few steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; added Andy and Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody else?&rdquo; questioned Captain Putnam,
gazing around at the assemblage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to, but I didn&rsquo;t do it, after you
said you didn&rsquo;t want a bonfire,&rdquo; said Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow, you admit you helped to gather the
wood. Did you kindle the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say, Ditmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t start any fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Century, how about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t start the fire, Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody had a can of carbide. To whom did
that belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was mine, sir,&rdquo; answered Fred. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
was going to show some of the fellows a new
way to light a fire, by mixing the carbide with
some water and generating acetylene gas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you light the gas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are positive?&rdquo; And now Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
voice was stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you the truth, Captain Putnam,&rdquo;
answered Fred, and looked the head of the school
squarely in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem! When you retired, what did you do
with the can of carbide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to put it back on my bicycle,
where it belongs, but I forgot it and left it by the
pile of brushwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a dangerous thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir, and I am sorry I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, who was corporal of the guard
when the fire started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Selick, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Selick, what cadets were on post
at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal of the guard consulted his time
book and read off the names of eight cadets, including
Mason, Sabine and Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mason, you said you saw some fire in the air,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam, to the lad who had been on
Post 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I did,&rdquo; answered Mason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you explain just what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I will as well as I can. I was walking
towards Post No. 3 when I saw some fire fly
into the air. The wind carried it towards the pile
of brushwood. All of a sudden the brushwood
was in a blaze, from the can of carbide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the fire fell on the carbide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s it, sir, and the carbide got wet
from the rain that was just starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you put the fire out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to, but it roared so from the carbide
and gas I got frightened,&mdash;and then the high wind
did the rest,&rdquo; answered Mason frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the fire came from the direction of
Post 3?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was on that post?&rdquo; asked the master of
the school, turning to the other guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the fire, Ritter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;that is, after Mason spoke
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why sir&mdash;I think&mdash;er&mdash;it came out of the sky.
Maybe it was from a fire balloon,&rdquo; added the bully,
struck by a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire balloon?&rdquo; queried Captain Putnam
doubtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;they set &rsquo;em off from the hotels
down the lake sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! And you think it was a fire balloon,
eh? What do you think, Mason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think, sir. I saw a little
fire flying through the air, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it more like the fire from a cigar, or
a cigarette?&rdquo; demanded Captain Putnam, searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;it might have been, sir. It wasn&rsquo;t
very large, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any of you guards smoking?&rdquo; demanded
Captain Putnam, looking at the eight cadets.</p>
<p>Nobody spoke, but Billy Sabine shifted uneasily
and grew very red in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sabine, answer me at once!&rdquo; cried the master
of the school. &ldquo;You were smoking, were you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Putnam, I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me at once!&rdquo; thundered Captain
Putnam, and striding forward he caught the
weak-kneed cadet by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&mdash;er&mdash;tried a cigarette Reff Ritter
gave me,&rdquo; gasped Sabine, in terror. &ldquo;But I
didn&rsquo;t set the wood on fire, sir. It was&mdash;was the
light from Ritter&rsquo;s cigarette did that!&rdquo; went on
Sabine, shaking from head to foot in fright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">RITTER GIVES A FEAST</span></h2>
<p>Billy Sabine&rsquo;s revelation caused a profound
sensation in the camp. Captain Putnam turned
sternly to Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say to this, Ritter?&rdquo; he
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;er&mdash;a mistake,&rdquo; stammered the bully.
&ldquo;I was only fooling Sabine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave him a cigarette, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, you see I&mdash;I found a box of them,
in the woods. I took one myself and let Sabine
have the other. We just lit them for a moment
and then put them out. Isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo; and
Ritter glared darkly at the cadet who had occupied
Post 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; stammered Sabine.
&ldquo;But, oh Captain Putnam, I didn&rsquo;t mean any
harm, really I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; wailed the weak-kneed
cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mason, you said the fire came from Ritter&rsquo;s
post, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the head of the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that direction, yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it look as if it might be from a
cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be from a cigarette, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, I rather think this is proof positive
that the fire may be laid at your door,&rdquo; went on
Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t light the bonfire,&rdquo; answered the bully
doggedly. &ldquo;At home I am allowed to smoke&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t do it here,&rdquo; he added sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is against the rules, that is why,
Ritter. I do not consider smoking good for any
growing boy. Your infringement of the rules did
a good deal of harm and it might have resulted
still more disastrously. I am afraid I shall have
to take up this matter with your father. You will
come to my tent, and you can come too, Mason
and Sabine. Major Ruddy, you may dismiss the
battalion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The necessary orders were given and the cadets
broke ranks, and gathered in knots to discuss the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter will catch it for this,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he will, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s afther deservin&rsquo; it,&rdquo;
answered Emerald. &ldquo;I had me ear burnt, so I
did, through his foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was said in Captain Putnam&rsquo;s tent did
not get out until some time later. The captain read
Ritter and Sabine a stern lecture, and said he
would send the bully&rsquo;s father a bill for the burnt
tents, and also said he would let Mr. Ritter know
how the conflagration had come about. He made
both boys promise not to smoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all your fault,&rdquo; growled Ritter, as he
and Sabine came away, followed by Mason. &ldquo;If
you had only kept your mouth shut we would have
been all right. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to give you a
licking!&rdquo; And he advanced so threateningly on
Sabine that the latter took to his heels and ran out
of sight.</p>
<p>When Mason came out he joined Pepper, Andy,
and some of their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to expose Ritter, but he was the
one to blame,&rdquo; said the cadet who had occupied
Post 4. &ldquo;He let the cigarette light fly right in
the carbide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should have put the carbide away,&rdquo;
said Fred, who was present</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to have it?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I went to the Hall on an errand for Captain
Putnam, and I came back on my wheel, and
carried it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I thought it would
be handy&mdash;to fill the acetylene lamp with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the excitement attending the fire and the
windstorm, matters moved along smoothly in the
camp for several days. During that time some of
the cadets got up a rowing race, between a crew
of four from Company A and another crew from
Company B. In this contest Company A won,
which helped them to get over their defeat on the
baseball field. Ritter did not row in the race, nor
did Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Ritter,&rdquo; said Henry Lee. &ldquo;He
might give up right in the middle of the race.
And we have better oarsmen than Gus Coulter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in the week Pepper heard through Mumps
that Paxton and Ritter were going after the nest
of hornets that had been discovered in the woods.
He at once went to Jack and Andy with the
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we might as well secure that nest,&rdquo;
said the young major. &ldquo;If the Ritter crowd get
it, there is no telling what they will do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;I&rsquo;m willing to get it,&rdquo; said The
Imp.</p>
<p>The three cadets walked into the woods and
then made the discovery that Ritter and Paxton
were just ahead of them. Paxton had a big, white
paper bag in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are too late!&rdquo; cried Andy in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, if they get the nest let us see what they
do with it,&rdquo; whispered Jack.</p>
<p>Taking care not to be seen, the young major
and his chums followed the bully and Paxton
through the woods until they came to the spot
where the hornets&rsquo; nest was located. It was after
sundown and the hornets had gone into the nest.</p>
<p>Paxton had a veil and this he put over his face
and then put on his white cadet gloves. This done
he climbed the tree from which the nest was
suspended and over the nest slipped his big paper
bag. Then he broke the nest loose and tied the
bag shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he cried in triumph! &ldquo;Now we
can have dead loads of fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it in Jack Ruddy&rsquo;s tent,&rdquo; said
Ritter. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll tell Ditmore and Snow the
major wants to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that!&rdquo; whispered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could break that bag over Ritter&rsquo;s
head,&rdquo; came from the acrobatic Andy.</p>
<p>Jack and his friends saw Ritter and Paxton
walk through the woods in another direction.
Then the bag with the hornets&rsquo; nest was left in the
crotch of a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They intend to come back for it to-night,&rdquo;
said Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper. &ldquo;Say,
it&rsquo;s great! We&rsquo;ll fix up a bogus bag and make an
exchange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion met with instant favor, and
while Jack watched the bag in the crotch of the
tree Pepper and Andy ran into camp, got some
paper and paste and made another bag, similar in
size and looks. Into the second bag they stuffed
some moss and dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jack, when the pair
came back. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll make the exchange.&rdquo;
And this was soon accomplished, and the bogus
bag left where the original had rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to let some of the other
fellows in on this trick,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
the laugh on Ritter and Paxton. More than
likely they&rsquo;ll tell their cronies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed to, and Dale, Fred, and half
a dozen others were told. Then Dale said he had
heard that Ritter was going to give a little feast
that night, he having sent to one of the lake hotels
for cake, and bottled soda water and root beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we could only get hold of that cake and
the soft drinks!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;A boatman
named Lemoss is going to bring them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must interview Lemoss,&rdquo; said Pepper, and
straightway he and Andy and Dale concocted a
scheme for intercepting the boatman with the
supplies.</p>
<p>This was an easy matter, for Lemoss was an
innocent fellow and did not dream that he was
being humbugged. He had been paid for the stuff
and turned it over to Pepper and Dale, when they
came out in a rowboat to meet him. The boys
quickly &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; the soda water and root beer
by adding to it a large dose of pepper and salt,
and they also peppered the cake. Then they
rowed to the shore and put the things out on a
fallen tree.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they rowed away than they saw
Ritter, Coulter and Paxton come out and look up
and down the lake. The chums were behind some
bushes and they heard Ritter utter an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the old fool hasn&rsquo;t put the things out
here on a log!&rdquo; came from the bully. &ldquo;How
careless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too lazy to row in and tell us,&rdquo; grumbled
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, the stuff is here, and that&rsquo;s the
main thing,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to have
some of the root beer now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve got to wait till to-night,&rdquo; said
Ritter. &ldquo;There is just enough to go around.&rdquo;
And then the things were smuggled up to the camp
and out of sight.</p>
<p>That evening when the cadets had an hour to
themselves, Pepper and Andy were accosted by
Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two fellows are wanted at Major Ruddy&rsquo;s
tent,&rdquo; said the little sneak. &ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; asked The Imp, with a grin to
his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word was passed along, that&rsquo;s all I know,&rdquo;
answered Mumps, and ran away, to avoid further
questioning.</p>
<p>Andy and Pepper hurried to the tent. On a cot
rested a neat package. It was addressed as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Major Jack Ruddy:</i></p>
<p><i>Call in your friends, Snow and Ditmore,
and treat them.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr"><i>Two Lady Friends.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, so you&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I
suppose the enemy is watching outside, to see
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; whispered Jack. &ldquo;I was going to
suggest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;Ritter celebrates
to-night. Why don&rsquo;t you postpone this&mdash;just to
throw them off the track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets held a consultation and then came
outside of the tent. They saw Ritter, Coulter and
several others hanging around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a fine cake,&rdquo; said Jack, in a low
voice, addressing his chums. &ldquo;Must have come
from the Fords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you could cut it to-night,&rdquo; grumbled
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will keep,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll invite the
crowd and open up the bundle to-morrow night,
eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll be on hand,&rdquo; said Pepper, and
then he and Andy walked away. A little later the
chums saw Ritter and his cronies slouch off much
disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to wait for our fun,&rdquo; growled
Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the hornets will be dead by that time,&rdquo;
said Paxton. &ldquo;But I suppose we can&rsquo;t help that.
Ritter, how about your celebration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be postponed,&rdquo; chuckled the bully.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a dandy time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word was passed around and after the camp
was quiet Ritter and his cronies stole away, taking
with them several bundles done up in newspapers.
They would have been astonished had they known
what was in one of the bundles&mdash;one smuggled in
by Pepper and Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The crowd went into the woods, and there by
the light of two lanterns Ritter brought out his
cake, root beer, soda water, and other good things
to eat and drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now help yourselves,&rdquo; cried the bully, good
naturedly.</p>
<p>Some cake was cut and passed around, and also
the drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! this is hot cake!&rdquo; cried Coulter, biting
into some pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; added Paxton. &ldquo;Say! my
mouth is on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, give me a drink! I&rsquo;ve got a mouthful of
salt!&rdquo; exclaimed another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you fellows batty&mdash;this cake is all
right!&rdquo; declared Ritter and filled his mouth with
the compound. The next instant he commenced
to splutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! I&rsquo;m on fire! Give me a drink, quick!
And he grabbed a bottle of soda water.</p>
<p>In the meantime the other lads had begun to
drink. They did not, however, swallow much, for
root beer and soda water with salt and pepper in
them are not very palatable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a trick!&rdquo; roared Reff Ritter, in a rage.
&ldquo;Somebody has doctored this stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try the other cake,&rdquo; said Coulter, pointing to
a bundle that had not yet been opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, but I suppose it&rsquo;s as bad as any of it,&rdquo;
grumbled the bully and tore the bundle apart savagely.
Then it slipped from his hand and struck
the ground violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ball has opened!&rdquo; came in a low voice
from Pepper, who with his chums, was viewing
the scene from a distance&mdash;a safe distance, they
hoped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">ON BUTTERFLY ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am stung!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nest of hornets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get out of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Wow! This is terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the cries rang out, as the paper bag broke
and the hornets&rsquo; nest fell to the ground with a
thump.</p>
<p>The hornets had been angry before, at being
imprisoned, and now the shock evidently made
them madder than ever. Out they swarmed about
Reff Ritter and his cronies, who slapped right and
left to ward them off.</p>
<p>Ritter was stung on the nose and on the chin,
and every one of the other lads was attacked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>For several seconds the bewildered boys did
not know what to do, and simply made wild
passes through the air at their enemies. Then,
with one accord, they attempted to run away. In
doing this Coulter bumped into Paxton, and both
went down and the hornets swarmed all around
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get away!&rdquo; screamed Gus Coulter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be stung to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me up!&rdquo; shrieked Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stung
in the eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your hornets&rsquo; nest!&rdquo; growled Coulter, and
getting up he went after the crowd, who were
scattering in all directions.</p>
<p>It was certainly the liveliest time imaginable
and Pepper and his chums roared heartily as they
saw the others doing their best to fight off the
little pests. Fortunately the Ritter crowd did not
come near them, so they were not bothered at all by
the hornets. Ritter ran for the lake shore, and
the whole crowd traveled nearly a quarter of a
mile before they dared to halt, so thoroughly
were they alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a case of the stinger getting
stung!&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment, after the excitement
was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager the Ritter crowd won&rsquo;t go back to
finish that feast,&rdquo; came from Dale, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad! So much good cake and stuff gone
to waste!&rdquo; said Stuffer, with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on back after it, Stuffer,&rdquo; said the young
major. &ldquo;I reckon they will let you have the
whole of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; cried the lad who loved to
eat. &ldquo;Think I want an introduction to those
hornets? Besides, the stuff is all doctored anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the fun was over, Jack and Pepper
and the others hurried back to camp and retired
for the night. They did not, however, go to sleep
but kept their ears open for the return of Ritter
and his cronies.</p>
<p>The bully&rsquo;s crowd came in about an hour later.
To keep the stings from hurting they had covered
the spots with soft mud and so everyone was a
sight to behold. All grumbled a good deal under
their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be more hateful than ever now,&rdquo; was
Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Better watch &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>On the following morning when Ritter and his
cronies appeared at roll call everybody else had
to smile. The bully had a big swelling on his
nose and another on his chin. Coulter had a
puffed-out cheek and Paxton had one eye closed.
As they lined up for inspection The Imp could
hardly keep from roaring outright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked
George Strong, as he caught sight of the bully&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some friends and I found a hornets&rsquo; nest in
the woods and the hornets got after us,&rdquo; was the
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; cried the teacher. &ldquo;I am very
sorry to hear it. Who else was stung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bully gave the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have some salve you can put on the hurts,&rdquo;
continued the teacher sympathetically. &ldquo;I will
get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we put salve on last night,&rdquo; said Ritter.
&ldquo;But maybe some more will help,&rdquo; he added
quickly, for the stings were still painful.</p>
<p>Jack and the others had expected an open row
with the bully and his cohorts, but it did not come.
As a matter of fact the crowd that had been stung
were so ashamed of their appearance that they
did all they could to keep out of sight. When it
was off-time they got two boats and rowed down
the lake, to a refreshment resort at which they
stopped whenever they got the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get square, you mark my words,&rdquo; cried
Reff Ritter, savagely, as all were waiting for ice-cream
to be served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how they got the hornets&rsquo;
nest,&rdquo; said Paxton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;They made some kind of an exchange,&rdquo; said
Coulter. &ldquo;And we got it in the neck!&rdquo; he added,
coarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and in the face and on our hands too,&rdquo;
added another cadet, who had a swollen forehead.</p>
<p>The cadets were about to leave the refreshment
place when they saw a carriage approaching on
the road which skirted the lake shore. The
carriage contained Mr. and Mrs. Ford and their
two daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we don&rsquo;t want to meet those folks,&rdquo;
said Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of them,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get out when I feel like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some were for going and some were for staying,
and the upshot of the matter was that Paxton
and two others remained. Ritter, Coulter and
the rest rowed off down the lake.</p>
<p>When the Paxton crowd came back they were
met by the others. Paxton was excited and looked
at Ritter and Coulter knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a note for Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said one
of the cadets, a lad named Wilbur who had only
been at the school a short while. &ldquo;That gentleman
who stopped at the refreshment place gave it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; asked Ritter, abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Paxton quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the encampment grounds were
reached Wilbur went off to deliver the note to
Jack. Paxton called Ritter and Coulter to him,
and the three walked away to a spot where nobody
could hear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That note to Ruddy is an invitation for the
Ruddy crowd to go on a picnic with the Fords,&rdquo;
said Paxton. &ldquo;I overheard the Fords mention
it when Mr. Ford was writing the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When and where?&rdquo; demanded Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going up to Butterfly Island day
after to-morrow, directly after breakfast. They&rsquo;ll
take lunch along and stay there until supper time.
They&rsquo;ve invited Ruddy, Ditmore, Snow and
Blackmore to participate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butterfly Island, eh?&rdquo; mused the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Say, why can&rsquo;t we go up there too and
spoil the fun?&rdquo; went on Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&mdash;if we can get away from the camp,&rdquo;
answered Ritter. &ldquo;Let us watch our chance and
see what we can do. How are they to go to the
island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ford is going to charter a launch, the
<i>Emma</i>, and will stop here for the others,&mdash;if
they get permission to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll get permission easily enough&mdash;Captain
Putnam wouldn&rsquo;t care to offend such a
rich man as Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this talk was going on the note was
delivered to Jack. The young major read it and
then sought out his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance for a fine outing!&rdquo; cried
Jack, and handed the invitation around for
inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Captain Putnam will let us accept,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;Let us go and ask him right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon found the head of the school and
showed him the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only remember
to be back by nightfall,&mdash;and don&rsquo;t get into any
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir up any hornets&rsquo; nests, for instance,&rdquo;
and Captain Putnam smiled meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let hornets severely alone,&rdquo; answered
Jack with a laugh.</p>
<p>Word was sent to the Fords that their kind
invitation was accepted, and then the four cadets
waited impatiently for the time for the picnic to
arrive. They went in undress uniform, and it is
safe to say that never did four lads brush up
more or pay more attention to their shoes, collars
and ties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is going to try to make the hit of his
life,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; was the answer,
while the young major&rsquo;s face grew red. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
grooming up as much as anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy has fixed his collar four times,&rdquo; came
from Dale. &ldquo;Say, you keep on and you&rsquo;ll have it
dirty before you start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the collar doesn&rsquo;t fit the shirt-band!&rdquo;
growled the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;I never saw such
a collar anyway!&rdquo; And he threw it aside and
adjusted a fresh one.</p>
<p>Promptly at the time appointed the launch
<i>Emma</i> appeared at a point of the shore near the
encampment. On board were the Ford family,
and the girls waved their handkerchiefs gaily at
the cadets, who waved their caps in return. Then
the launch came closer and the boys clambered
aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad the weather is fair!&rdquo; cried
Laura, after the greetings were over. &ldquo;I thought
last night it would rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We looked at the sky about every ten
minutes,&rdquo; answered Pepper, and this caused a
laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Last night it looked as if we might not get
here,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford. &ldquo;The engine of the launch
broke down and the man had quite a time fixing
it. But he finally got it to working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t work just right yet,&rdquo; put in the
man who was running the craft. &ldquo;But I reckon
I can fix her while you folks are having your
picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butterfly Island was a narrow strip of land
lying some distance from the eastern shore of
Lake Caboy. It was a well-wooded spot and used
frequently by Sunday schools and societies for
picnic purposes. Mr. Ford had learned that no
picnic would be held that day, however, so they
would have the island to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp out in regular hunter style,&rdquo; declared
Flossie. &ldquo;We brought a coffee pot and a
frying pan, and you boys can build a big camp
fire, and we&rsquo;ll set the table, and all that! Won&rsquo;t
it be just too lovely for anything?&rdquo; And her eyes
beamed brightly.</p>
<p>The launch ran slowly and it was nearly an
hour before the island was reached. Then all
went ashore, and the boys carried the things that
had been brought along to a spot the girls picked
out. This was on a high, grassy knoll that overlooked
the southern end of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>While the Fords and the boys proceeded to
make themselves at home, the man who owned the
launch got to work to fix his motor. A fire was
lit and when it came lunch time the girls made
hot coffee and fried some lake bass that had been
caught that morning near the hotel. A table
cloth was spread out under the trees, and all sat
around it and enjoyed the coffee and fish, and the
numerous good things brought along by the Fords
from the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Stuffer ought to see us now!&rdquo; whispered
Andy to Dale, while munching on a piece of
cream cake. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he turn green with
envy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what would Ritter and his crowd
say?&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;No hornets&rsquo; nest in this,
eh?&rdquo; And he smiled broadly.</p>
<p>When the meal was ready the man from the
launch had been called up from the shore, and he
was given his share of the good things and sat off
by himself to enjoy them. He said he had taken
off a part of one of the cylinders of the launch and
hoped, when he put it back, that the engine would
work better.</p>
<p>An hour was spent in eating, and then the man
left the picnic ground to return to his work on the
launch. The young folks cleared away the remains
of the repast and then the boys invited the
girls to take a walk completely around the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful and don&rsquo;t get into any trouble,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here until you
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path around the shore of Butterfly Island
was rough, but the young folks did not mind this.
Jack led the way, and he and the other cadets
helped the girls down and up the rocks, and
&ldquo;jumped&rdquo; them over the hollows. All were in
the best of spirits, and the woods rang with
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on out to the headland,&rdquo; said Andy
presently, and led the way to a narrow strip of
land extending out into the lake for fully a hundred
feet. All followed and Andy was about to
point out some object of interest when Pepper,
who chanced to glance back, uttered a cry of
alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">AN ADVENTURE WITH SNAKES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Pepper?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;I guess I was mistaken,&rdquo;
stammered Pepper, looking first at his chums and
then at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was it?&rdquo; questioned Laura. &ldquo;Why,
you gave a regular jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;Oh, never mind,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. &ldquo;Go on, I&rsquo;ll be with you in
a minute,&rdquo; and he turned back on the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; muttered Dale to himself,
and as Andy and Jack went on with the girls
he sided up to The Imp. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; he
asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I saw a big snake, Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back between the rocks we just crossed. It
poked its head up and looked right at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to alarm the girls. If they
thought a snake was near they&rsquo;d have a fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is so. Well, I hate snakes myself.
Let us see if this one is still around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys walked back, but not for far. As
they placed their feet on one of the rocks that
joined the headland to the island proper they
heard a vigorous hissing, and not one but three
snakes of good size showed themselves.</p>
<p>The cadets were so startled that both let out a
yell and tried to retreat. Their cries reached the
others in the party, and all turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a snake! a snake!&rdquo; screamed Flossie, as
she caught sight of one of the reptiles. &ldquo;Oh,
what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see two of them!&rdquo; said Laura, and gave a
shudder. &ldquo;Oh, dear me! And they are right
between us and the island! However are we to
get back to the picnic grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the young folks kept at a distance. Two
of the snakes were still in sight, the third had
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we had better stone &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do if I was alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that they may come for us,&rdquo;
answered Flossie, almost tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had sticks!&rdquo; sighed Dale, but there
were no sticks or bushes on the headland, only
grass and rocks.</p>
<p>The cadets talked the situation over and then,
leaving the girls at the extreme end of the headland,
the lads picked up a number of jagged
stones and advanced with caution to where the
snakes had been seen. Two were still in view and
they aimed at these and hit each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; cried Andy, as the
snakes dropped back in a hollow and commenced
to squirm around. &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em some more stones!&rdquo;
The stones were forthcoming and one that was
well-aimed took the larger of the two snakes in
the head, killing it. But the other continued to
whip around, and presently came out on the rocks
and in the direction of the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit him with another stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was trying to get another stone when the
snake made a sudden move and twined around
the young major&rsquo;s ankle. Jack took his free foot
and tried to kick it off, but in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>It was now that Dale showed his nerve. Like
a flash he pulled out his jackknife and opened
the blade. Then he bent down and slashed away
quickly at the snake, ripping open the reptile&rsquo;s
back. Then he struck the snake in the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;give it to him!&rdquo; gasped Jack, and
Dale continued to use his knife. The girls
screamed loudly and wrung their hands. Then
the snake, cut in two, dropped down on the rocks.
Andy kicked the severed parts into the water and
they sank from sight. Pepper kicked the other
snake into the water also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, this is terrible!&rdquo; moaned Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we were back to papa and mamma,&rdquo;
sighed Laura. Both girls looked as if they were
ready to faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get scared,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;They are
both dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there may be others,&rdquo; said Flossie. She
turned to Jack. &ldquo;Did the snake bite you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t get a chance, thanks to Dale,&rdquo;
answered the young major, with a grateful glance
at his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try to go back?&rdquo; asked Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until we make sure that the way is
clear,&rdquo; said Pepper, who had not forgotten about
the third snake.</p>
<p>He went back with caution and made an
inspection. The third snake was nowhere in
sight, and what had become of it he could not tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you girls had better let us carry you,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;Then the snakes won&rsquo;t be able to
get at you, even if they do appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the girls demurred at being carried.
But they hated to step where the snakes had
shown themselves, and finally consented. Pepper
took Flossie in his arms and Jack followed with
Laura, and Andy and Dale, armed with stones
and their jackknives, led the way. The girls
might have giggled at being taken up like children,
but they were too alarmed to do so.</p>
<p>Just as the headland was passed and Pepper
and Jack had deposited their burdens on their
feet, Mr. and Mrs. Ford appeared. The gentleman
and his wife were greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we hear the girls scream?&rdquo; asked the
lady anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you did, mamma,&rdquo; answered Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran into a nest of snakes!&rdquo; said Flossie.
&ldquo;The boys killed two of them! Oh, it was awful!&rdquo;
And Flossie ran to her mother and caught
her by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snakes!&rdquo; exclaimed Rossmore Ford.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys pointed out the spot and told what
had been done. Mr. and Mrs. Ford were much
concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better not climb over any more of
the rocks,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;It is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the snakes are poisonous,&rdquo; said
her husband. &ldquo;Still, I think we had all better
try to keep out of their way after this. I did not
think there were any on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks who hold picnics here ought to know
about them,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, snakes are to be found almost anywhere
where there are rocks,&rdquo; answered Rossmore Ford.
&ldquo;Come, let us go back to where we left our
things. My wife and I were just dozing away
with our backs to a tree when we heard the
screams. We could not locate them at first and
were much worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that the girls would not care to climb
the rocks after such a scare, the cadets walked
back to the camping place with the Fords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you knifed that snake, Dale,&rdquo; said
Jack on the way. &ldquo;It was a brave thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; was the modest reply.
&ldquo;I was once in a camp in the mountains and saw
an old hunter do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party had hardly reached the spot where
the campfire had been built when the man who
ran the launch appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly of
Mr. Ford. &ldquo;I have been looking all over for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Mr. Fales?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see you about the launch. She is
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed Rossmore Ford, while the
cadets listened with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;disappeared while I was having
dinner. I thought she might have drifted around
the shore, but I can&rsquo;t find her anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tie her fast?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I always tie up when I come
ashore,&rdquo; answered Able Fales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go down to the shore and take a look
around,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>Wondering over what had become of the boat,
the entire party left the picnic grounds and
hurried down to the lake front. Here was a small
cove where they had landed, and Able Fales
pointed out an overhanging tree to which he had
secured his craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she got loose I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d drift
out of the cove,&rdquo; said the boatman. &ldquo;There is
no current here to carry her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is gone, sure,&rdquo; remarked Andy. He
turned to his chums. &ldquo;What do you make of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to say,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think it is a trick?&rdquo; questioned
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like it? Remember the hornets&rsquo;
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and look there!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy. &ldquo;If
that isn&rsquo;t the limit! Yes, it&rsquo;s a trick all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acrobatic youth pointed to the tree to which
the launch had been fastened. From a cord on
the tree hung the hornets&rsquo; nest, now empty.
Pinned to the nest was a bit of paper. The boys
secured the sheet and read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Use this nest if you have to stay out all
night.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE MISSING LAUNCH</span></h2>
<p>As the cadets read the words on the sheet of
paper their faces showed their deep chagrin and
mortification. Had they been alone they would
have considered the affair a trick on them and
nothing more, but with the Fords along it was an
entirely different matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that? Let me see it,&rdquo; said Laura,
and took the paper from Andy&rsquo;s hand. She read
the words aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I do not understand this,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;What has this empty hornets&rsquo; nest
to do with the launch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that a trick has been played on us,&rdquo;
said Jack, his face growing red. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a
shame to involve you in it&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll tell those
other fellows so, when I get the chance!&rdquo; he
added, half savagely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it about?&rdquo; asked Rossmore Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well make a clean breast of it,&rdquo;
said Pepper to his chums, and then he related the
particulars of the hornets&rsquo; nest and how it had
been used during the Ritter feast. The girls
laughed outright and Mr. and Mrs. Ford smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here is where the Ritter crowd pay us
back,&rdquo; went on Pepper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they
got here, but they did&mdash;and they have either
hidden the launch or made off with it. I am
awfully sorry&mdash;on your account,&rdquo; and he looked
anxiously at the Fords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are in the same boat as ourselves,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you mean we are both out of the boat,&rdquo;
returned Andy, with a sickly grin. He turned
to Able Fales. &ldquo;Have you looked all along the
shore for the launch?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But I can
take another look. So it was some friends of
yours took the boat, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly friends,&rdquo; answered Dale dryly.
&ldquo;They belong to our military school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you fellers are full of tricks. Took
the bell clapper of the church once,&rdquo; went on the
boatman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Another search was made by the boatman and
the boys and Mr. Ford joined in the hunt. But not
a trace of the missing craft could be found. Jack
looked at his watch and saw that it was nearly
five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t the worst yet!&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Pepper, what do you think we had best do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If they don&rsquo;t bring the boat
back we may have to remain on the island all
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a hardship on Mrs. Ford and
the girls. They are not used to roughing it, and
there is nothing but a shed here, and that isn&rsquo;t
very clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had a canoe, or even a raft, we might
get to the mainland and hire another boat,&rdquo; said
Dale. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we build a raft of some kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might, but it would take time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on Andy had
walked to some high rocks overlooking the lower
end of the lake. Now, of a sudden, he set up a
shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat ahoy! Hello! Come in here, we want
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy has sighted a boat!&rdquo; ejaculated Pepper,
and ran to join the acrobatic youth, and his chums
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>All saw a launch moving up the lake. It contained
a young lady of about twenty and a boy of
sixteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the boy, as the
launch came to a standstill out in the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want help!&rdquo; called back Andy. &ldquo;Will
you please come ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; questioned the girl, as she
set the motor of the boat in motion once more
and steered for the shore of Butterfly Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our boat is gone,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is Belle Penwick!&rdquo; cried Laura, as
she caught sight of the girl in the launch. &ldquo;And
her brother Roger! How fortunate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know them?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we are old friends, and they are
stopping at the same hotel with us. That is
Belle&rsquo;s boat, but her brother Roger aids her in
running it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Spray</i>, for that was the name of the craft,
soon came close to the shore, and then the engine
was stopped once more. The boys were introduced
to the newcomers, and the latter were told
about the missing <i>Emma</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we saw that boat about an hour ago!&rdquo;
cried Roger Penwick. &ldquo;Some cadets dressed like
you fellows had her in tow and were taking her
towards Hull Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they leave her there?&rdquo; questioned Jack</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the cadets in a rowboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they couldn&rsquo;t run the launch because
of the dismantled motor,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Most likely they hid her in the bushes on the
shore of Hull Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and the Penwicks
said they would take some of the party over to
Hull Island if they wished to go. It was
arranged that Jack, Andy and Able Fales should
make the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the launch is there I&rsquo;ll fix her up as soon
as I can and run her back here,&rdquo; said the old
boatman.</p>
<p>The <i>Spray</i> was soon on the way. She was a
light-built craft and cut the bosom of the lake
like a thing of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like my sloop, but I declare I&rsquo;d like a motor
boat too,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;They certainly can
travel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t have to wait for the wind,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine&mdash;if the motor doesn&rsquo;t get out of
order,&rdquo; said Roger Penwick. &ldquo;But sister and I
have to do a lot of tinkering, I can tell you!
Yesterday we spent about an hour sailing around
and two hours fixing the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my spark wasn&rsquo;t just right, that was
all,&rdquo; responded Belle. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make a boat
run well without a good electric spark,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<p>The run to Hull Island, a small patch of land
close to the upper end of Lake Caboy, did not take
long, and then the island was slowly circled, while
the boys and the old boatman scanned the shore
with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is, there&rsquo;s the <i>Emma</i>!&rdquo; cried Abel
Fales, presently, and pointed out his craft, shoved
in under some overhanging bushes. &ldquo;Pretty well
hidden, I must say! I would have had a hard job
finding her if you hadn&rsquo;t seen her being taken
here,&rdquo; he added to the Penwicks.</p>
<p>The Ritter crowd had done nothing to the launch
but tow her off, and soon Able Fales was at work
fixing his engine. With the cylinder repaired the
machinery worked very well, and both craft
started back to Butterfly Island, arriving there a
little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you can come in my boat if you wish,
it will make your run easier,&rdquo; said Belle Penwick,
and then it was arranged that Andy and Dale
and Flossie should go with her. This divided up
the weight of passengers pretty evenly, and when
the two boats left the island they kept close beside
each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan to scare the Ritter crowd,&rdquo;
said Jack, on the way home, and then he explained
what it was.</p>
<p>The Fords were willing to let him carry out his
idea, Rossmore Ford being especially anxious to
make the boys who had taken the <i>Emma</i> suffer for
the trick. Jack and his chums were landed at a
distance up the lake shore from the encampment,
and the <i>Emma</i> took care to keep out of sight as
she swung down the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em locked up if they don&rsquo;t
return my boat by to-morrow morning!&rdquo; cried
Able Fales, who, now that he had his boat back,
entered into the spirit of the fun that was afloat.</p>
<p>Jack and his chums watched their opportunity
and stole into camp without being noticed by anybody
but one of the guards. They slipped to their
tents and donned their regular uniforms, and the
young major buckled on his sword.</p>
<p>As the cadets came out on the parade ground
they saw Ritter, Coulter and Paxton directly
ahead of them. They hurried on, and soon caught
up to the trio, who were conversing earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get away until morning, and I
know it,&rdquo; Ritter was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they were mad when they saw the
hornets&rsquo; nest,&rdquo; came from Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they ate up everything they carried for
dinner they will have to go without supper and
breakfast,&rdquo; added Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Ritter!&rdquo; cried Jack, pleasantly.</p>
<p>The entire crowd ahead wheeled around and a
look of blank astonishment came into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;where did you come from?&rdquo; stammered
Ritter. He did not know what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Butterfly Island,&rdquo; answered Jack.
Then he lowered his voice and added: &ldquo;Ritter,
you and your cronies have got yourselves in a nice
mess. You stole Mr. Fales&rsquo;s boat, and he says if
you don&rsquo;t return it to him by to-morrow morning
he&rsquo;ll have you all locked up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">A WILD GOOSE CHASE</span></h2>
<p>The announcement that Jack made filled the
Ritter crowd with alarm, and they showed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have us arrested?&rdquo; cried the bully, and he
grew somewhat pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what he said,&rdquo; broke in Pepper.
&ldquo;Fun is fun, but to steal a launch is another
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t steal the boat,&rdquo; came from Coulter.
&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;What do you know about it anyway?&rdquo;
he demanded suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know all we wish to know,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;You took Mr. Fales&rsquo;s boat and did not return
it. You can well imagine how angry he is. He
looked all around Butterfly Island for it, but with
no success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t leave it at Butterfly Island,&rdquo; said
Paxton. We left it&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short and
looked at his cronies questioningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get away from the island?&rdquo;
asked Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A party came along in another launch, the
<i>Spray</i>,&rdquo; said Jack, and did not attempt to explain
further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;we hid the <i>Emma</i> on the shore of
another island,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hurt
the boat in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you better return her before morning, or
Mr. Fales may get out warrants for your whole
crowd,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;After we found the
hornets&rsquo; nest he wanted to know who you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I suppose you told him too,&rdquo;
sneered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You put us in a hole. But you&rsquo;d
better get the boat. Don&rsquo;t you know that there
are some thieves on this lake? They wouldn&rsquo;t
hesitate to take that launch if they found it, and
paint it over and change the name&mdash;and then
you&rsquo;d never find the craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll get into serious trouble if you
don&rsquo;t return that boat by morning,&rdquo; said the
young major, and then he motioned to his chums
and all walked away. Looking back they saw the
Ritter crowd get together and commence an
earnest conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager they go out after the launch,&rdquo; said
Andy, with a broad grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be surprised when they find the
boat missing from Hull Island!&rdquo; came from The
Imp. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think she drifted away or was
stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they go out they may get wet,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;It certainly looks like rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums joined the other cadets, and pretended
to pay no further attention to the Ritter
faction. But on the sly Dale watched them and
after taps saw Ritter, Coulter, Paxton and
Sabine steal away in the direction of the lake.
They took one of the rowboats with two pairs of
oars and rowed away in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a wild goose chase for you!&rdquo; cried
Jack, and he and his chums laughed heartily over
the matter. The young major was right&mdash;it was
indeed a wild goose chase. The row to Hull
Island was a hard one, and when the spot was
reached the search for the launch in the darkness
was difficult. To add to the discomfort of the
crowd it commenced to rain, and as they had no
covering each of the cadets got wet to the skin.
They all spent over an hour looking for the <i>Emma</i>,
but all in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have drifted away, or else she was
stolen!&rdquo; groaned Billy Sabine. &ldquo;Oh, if we don&rsquo;t
find her, will they really lock us up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t drift away, for she was tied up,&rdquo;
said Ritter. &ldquo;I tied her myself, and I did it good,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody was around here when we brought the
launch in,&rdquo; came from Paxton. &ldquo;I looked around
good. And I don&rsquo;t know how any thieves could
locate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I am beginning to think?&rdquo;
cried Ritter. &ldquo;I think they played a trick on
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got the boat back, but made up a plot
to get us out on the hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might row down the lake to where they
usually keep the launch and find out,&rdquo; said Paxton.
&ldquo;We better do it. I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink
if I thought I was going to be arrested in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Sabine, with a shiver. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over three miles from here,&rdquo; grumbled
Ritter. Nevertheless, he was as much disturbed
as anyone, and in the end the four took up the
oars and commenced the tedious task of rowing
down the lake in the rain. It was an hour before
they reached the dock where the launch was
usually kept. They came in rather awkwardly
and bumped loudly against the stringpiece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; cried Ritter, as he made out the
<i>Emma</i> tied securely to the dock. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that Ruddy crowd played a trick on us&mdash;getting
us to look for her in this rain!&rdquo;
grumbled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! what does this mean? Who are
you?&rdquo; came a call from the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shove off! We don&rsquo;t want to meet anybody!&rdquo;
said Ritter in a low voice.</p>
<p>The rowboat had drifted in and was now between
the launch and the dock, and it was hard
work to shove the craft out into the lake. They
heard footsteps and a man showed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he called loudly. &ldquo;Stop, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo;
And now he pointed a pistol at the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; screamed Sabine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
shoot! We haven&rsquo;t done anything, mister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stop,&rdquo; called the man. He was a watchman,
employed by Able Fales and a number of
others, to look after the various craft in that
vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Ritter endeavored to assure
the watchman. &ldquo;We only stopped in here to see
if a certain boat was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine time to do it, I must say!&rdquo; returned the
watchman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past one o&rsquo;clock! What
boat were you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;er&mdash;the <i>Emma</i>,&rdquo; stammered Coulter, as
Ritter paused before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know now!&rdquo; said the watchman, and his
face took on a grin. He sprang aboard the <i>Emma</i>
and so got closer to the quartet of cadets. &ldquo;You
are from that military school, ain&rsquo;t you? You
run off with the boat, and Able sent word he&rsquo;d
have you locked up if you didn&rsquo;t return her! Ha!
ha! Able got the boat all right, and you&rsquo;ve had a
fine time looking for her! It&rsquo;s a nice night
for a long row! No dust, nor nuthin&rsquo; like that!&rdquo;
And the watchman laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you dry up!&rdquo; said Ritter, in deep disgust,
&ldquo;Come on back to camp,&rdquo; he added to his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to touch any of these boats
ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo; shouted the watchman. &ldquo;If you do you&rsquo;ll
git shot!&rdquo; And then the rowboat started up the
lake for the encampment. Ritter and his cronies
were wet through and through and thoroughly
tired out when they got back, and a more disgusted
crowd it would be hard to imagine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>On the following Monday came a tug-of-war
between two teams composed of ten cadets each.
Dale, Hogan and Andy were on one team, and
their side won, after a tug that lasted sixteen
minutes. The tug-of-war was followed by a game
of hare and hounds, or, as some boys called it, a
paper chase. In the paper chase Andy and
Pepper were the &ldquo;hares&rdquo; and Dale the leader
of the &ldquo;hounds,&rdquo; which numbered about thirty
cadets. The &ldquo;hares&rdquo; carried big bags of paper cut
into fine pieces which they scattered on the ground
as a trail, so the &ldquo;hounds&rdquo; could follow them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hares will have just ten minutes start,&rdquo;
announced Jack, who had been chosen umpire
and referee. &ldquo;Now then, Andy and Pepper, are
you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets looked to their shoe laces, their
belts, and their bags of paper, and then announced
that they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go!&rdquo; shouted the young major, and off
Andy and Pepper bounded, across the camp and
into the woods. They took to a road leading westward,
but presently came to a trail running southward
and switched off to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get a good start in ten minutes,&rdquo;
remarked Pepper, as they moved along on a dog
trot, dropping the fine bits of paper on the
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t forget that those other fellows
can run too,&rdquo; returned the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;Say,
but it&rsquo;s a fine day, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; he added, and then,
coming to a cleared space, his spirits arose and he
turned several hand-springs in quick succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, stop that!&rdquo; called Pepper. &ldquo;Save your
wind for running, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to do a stunt once in a while or I&rsquo;ll bust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cadets presently came to a hill and
climbed this and then dropped from a cliff to the
gully below. They left paper everywhere, so the
trail would be plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get down the cliff one at a
time,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;That will retard them a little&mdash;if
they want to keep in a bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently they came to another road and
followed this for over a mile. Then they left the
road and took to another trail through the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a river!&rdquo; cried Andy, presently.
&ldquo;Hark how the water roars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this stream,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;It is the
Caboy River, and what you hear are the Falls.
This is the place where that haunted mill is
located.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED UNDERGROUND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Robertson mill?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the one mentioned by that Bert Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard from that boy, Pepper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go to the old mill and see what it
looks like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might pass it. We haven&rsquo;t time to stop&mdash;not
unless we want to get caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still walking swiftly, the chums went along the
river until they came in sight of the Falls. Not
far off was the old mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll meet that ghost?&rdquo; asked Andy, as
they paused at a distance to gaze at the ancient
structure, some of the lower windows of which
had been boarded over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m sure. Want to go closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then, and we&rsquo;ll scatter some paper
near the door. Maybe the crowd will think we
entered the mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing they had no time to spare, if they
wanted to keep out of the reach of the hounds,
the two cadets hurried on until they stood beneath
a shed adjoining the old mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything unusual,&rdquo; said Pepper,
as he looked around. &ldquo;Maybe this story about
a ghost is all made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what about that yarn of a ghost that
was half man, half beast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I think&mdash;&mdash;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys listened. From inside the old mill a
grating sound had reached their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wonder if the wheel is going!&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;It sounds like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look in at the door and see&mdash;if the door
is unlocked,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>The chums stepped closer to the doors of the
mill. Scarcely had they done so when, without
warning, some planking gave way and they found
themselves dropping into some space below. Each
tried to save himself, but it was too late, and down
they went, into a lower apartment of the old mill.
Then, as swiftly as it had moved before, the
planking overhead closed, leaving the two cadets
in almost total darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>They were completely bewildered by what had
occurred, and for the moment could do little but
clutch each other and try to pierce the darkness
which surrounded them. Andy had gone sprawling,
with Pepper on top of him. Now both arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
trying vainly to control his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess we have been trapped!&rdquo; gasped
Andy. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish we had a pistol, or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we fall or was a trap-door opened, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess a door was opened. Anyway, the
opening is closed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe any ghost did it, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was some human being. But that
human being might be just as bad as a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. How are we going to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys felt around them. On every side
was a stone wall. In two of the walls were doors.
One was locked, but the other stood partly open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are down here we may as well do a
little exploring,&rdquo; whispered Pepper. &ldquo;But let us
keep close together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care that you don&rsquo;t fall into another
hole!&rdquo; answered his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can&rsquo;t find sticks, or stones, or
something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>They felt around but nothing but the bare
walls and bare floor met their touch.</p>
<p>At a distance they heard a strange rumble, but
could not make out what it was or where it came
from. They advanced with caution and passed
through the open door. All was as dark as before,
but they heard a rushing close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that wind?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that must be the river, or the falls, Andy.
We can&rsquo;t be very far from the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had reached a flooring of wood.
They passed along on this for several feet. They
were side by side, trying to pierce the darkness,
which was intense. A foul, musty odor greeted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to see daylight again,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further, for just then the flooring
upon which they stood tilted downward. Both
tried to save themselves from another fall, but in
vain. Down they rolled over the flooring and fell
with a splash into the water.</p>
<p>Pepper went down several feet and his hand
struck some rocks. Andy followed, and the chums
grabbed each other by the shoulder. The ducking
came so quickly that each swallowed considerable
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; spluttered Pepper, when he
could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in the river!&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;Look
out that you don&rsquo;t hit your head on something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was flowing swiftly, and forward
shot the two boys, in darkness that was as intense
as before. They felt the passageway narrowing
and felt the sharp rocks on either side of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be in the river!&rdquo; gasped Pepper.
&ldquo;We must be in some underground stream, an
off-shoot from the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right!&rdquo; groaned his chum.
&ldquo;But if it is an off-shoot where is it taking us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little opportunity to say more, for
the water was now boiling and foaming all around
them. The boys were jerked first one way and
then another, and all but had the breath knocked
from their bodies. Andy was hit on the head by
a projecting rock and dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; he moaned, and Pepper clutched
him and held fast. Then Pepper was struck
and for several minutes knew no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>When the two boys were able to realize what had
happened they found themselves still in the dark,
but almost out of the water, which was rushing
madly beside them. On all sides were rough
rocks, some of them of immense size. From far
overhead came a glimmer of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Andy?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
when he felt strong enough to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; was the gasped-out answer.
&ldquo;But say, I don&rsquo;t want to go through anything
like that again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I! We came close to being drowned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and close to having our heads pounded to
a jelly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere among the rocks below the old
mill. Instead of following the river we were
caught in a side stream that flows under and between
the rocks. I suppose we can be thankful
that our lives were spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes the cadets were content to
rest and gather their scattered wits together. The
game of hare and hounds was completely forgotten
until Andy chanced to glance at a big water-soaked
paper still slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what became of the other fellows,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they didn&rsquo;t fall down the hole,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. &ldquo;But if they did I reckon we
would have heard it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>How to get out of the place in which they found
themselves was a serious problem. On all sides
were the great rocks. The opening through which
the light was streaming was fully fifty feet over
their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the only thing to do is to climb out,&rdquo;
was Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Think we can do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try. But we don&rsquo;t want to break our
necks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the upper end of the opening,&rdquo;
suggested the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;It looks better
to me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked to the spot Andy indicated, and
then the acrobatic youth commenced to scale the
rocks. Pepper followed, and thus they managed
to climb about half the distance to the top. But
at that point little short of sheer walls confronted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we are stumped,&rdquo; said Andy, in a
disappointed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if the other fellows are in this vicinity,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;If they are they could help
us out somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might call, Pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the boys called out at the top of their
lungs, not once but several times. At first no
answer came back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; said Pepper, and they did so.
The echoes had just died away when they saw a
form appear at the top of the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is down there?&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two boys,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;We want somebody
to help us get out of this hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the person at the top of
the hole. &ldquo;Well, maybe, I can do the trick. I
happen to have a long rope with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the voice of the speaker struck
Pepper as familiar. He strained his eyes, and
then saw that the person who had spoken was the
strange lad, Bert Field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">BERT FIELD&rsquo;S REVELATION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Bert Field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself,&rdquo; answered the lad at the top
of the opening, in surprise. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of the Putnam Hall cadets, Pepper
Ditmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one of the fellows I met at the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have a friend with me, Andy Snow.
Can you help us to get out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I can,&rdquo; was the answer from the boy
above. &ldquo;Can you climb a rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; answered Andy quickly. &ldquo;And if
Pepper can&rsquo;t perhaps the two of us can pull him
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here you are then. But wait till I
tie the rope fast,&rdquo; continued Bert Field.</p>
<p>Quickly the end of a stout rope dropped into
the opening. Then came a pause, and then the
boy above shouted out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy caught hold of the rope and now his
ability as an acrobat stood him in good stead.
Up the line he went, hand over hand, in a manner
that would have done credit to a circus performer.
Then Pepper tried it, and after a struggle came
up, too, although much more slowly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="Up the line he went, hand over hand." width="500" height="771" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Up the line he went, hand over hand.</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you get down there?&rdquo;
asked Bert Field, after the two cadets were safe.
&ldquo;I see you are pretty wet,&rdquo; he continued, glancing
at their soaked garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long story,&rdquo; answered Pepper,
with a side glance at Andy, to keep the latter
quiet. &ldquo;By the way, Field, didn&rsquo;t you say that
you were looking for the old mill in this vicinity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said so, yes,&rdquo; was the slow reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what you know about that old
mill?&rdquo; went on Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;that is&mdash;it is a personal matter, a
family matter,&rdquo; stammered Bert Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that if you told us something about
the old mill we might be able to help you,&rdquo; went
on Pepper. &ldquo;Has Jabez Trask something to do
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is why you were looking for Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Bert Field&rsquo;s face became a study. He
looked at Pepper and Andy with eyes that seemed
to pierce them through and through. &ldquo;I wonder
if I can trust you?&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the thing is on the level you can trust me,&rdquo;
added Andy. He saw that the strange lad was
laboring under some subdued excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I need a friend,&rdquo; went on Bert
Field. &ldquo;I said once I might need help. I may be
able to solve this mystery alone, but somehow I
am beginning to doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is a mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the old mill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and about Jabez Trask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a little smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story and maybe you won&rsquo;t want to
listen to it now&mdash;with your clothing all wet. You
may take cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Can
you meet us to-morrow evening near our encampment
up the lake shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you say so. I was going to use this
rope to-day&mdash;but I can postpone that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll postpone our story,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Bert Field showed them the way back to the
trail through the woods and then separated from
them. Andy and Pepper saw the odd youth
slouch off with the coil of rope hung over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is certainly a queer stick,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;I venture to say he&rsquo;ll have a queer
story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have a queer one to tell too,&rdquo; replied
Andy. &ldquo;Wonder what he was going to do
with that rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out. Maybe he was
going to make the ghost a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to keep our adventure a
secret,&rdquo; went on The Imp. &ldquo;Maybe some day
we&rsquo;ll be able to solve this secret of the old mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am willing to keep it a secret for the
present. But we want to find out what the others
have to say first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys walked through the woods and on
coming out on a regular road saw the hounds in a
crowd, evidently hunting for the paper scent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; cried Dale, on seeing them.
He ran up, followed by the others. &ldquo;Where in the
world did you go to?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went into the water,&rdquo; answered Andy, pointing
to his uniform. &ldquo;Got a free bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; burst out another cadet. &ldquo;No
wonder we missed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far did you follow us?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost to the old mill. But some of the
fellows wouldn&rsquo;t go there, so we went in a semi-circle,
but we couldn&rsquo;t find the scent anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tumbled into the water before we knew it,&rdquo;
said Pepper, telling the plain truth. &ldquo;And we
had an awful time getting out, for the current
carried us quite a distance. We are wet through
and through and want to get to camp as soon as
possible, to change our clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Well, this
ends the game,&rdquo; he added, to his followers.</p>
<p>The whole crowd returned to the camp, and
Andy and Pepper lost no time in taking a good
rubbing down and in changing their raiment.
The others thought they had simply slipped into
the river and did not ask for particulars. Nevertheless,
that evening, when they got the opportunity,
Andy and Pepper gave Jack and Dale the
details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is certainly queer,&rdquo; was the comment
of the young major. &ldquo;Some wicked person
must be hanging out at that old mill. But for
what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a counterfeiters&rsquo; den,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;But
somehow I&rsquo;ve got one idea fixed in my mind and
I can&rsquo;t get it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Pep?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think old Jabez Trask is mixed up in it.
You&rsquo;ll remember how he acted at his mansion.
Well, isn&rsquo;t this a good deal like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but what would Trask be doing at
the old mill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He may be trying to keep
others from going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? An old, tumble-down mill like
that is of no account. I doubt if there is anything
about the place worth stealing. A thief couldn&rsquo;t
take the ground, and that is all there is of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll learn what this Bert Field has to
say,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could all meet him,&rdquo; came from Dale,
who was now as much interested in the mystery as
anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Anyway, I
can ask him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promptly at the time appointed, Andy and
Pepper went off to meet Bert Field. They had
mentioned an old tree with a broken limb, and
they found the strange boy there, pacing the
ground nervously. He gave a start when Andy
called to him, but when he recognized them he
called up a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is as nervous as a cat,&rdquo; whispered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has good cause to be,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>As soon as the cadets reached Bert Field, they
mentioned Jack and Dale and the strange boy said
they might be summoned if desired. Andy let out
a shrill whistle, which Dale answered, and soon
the latter and the young major appeared, and the
whole crowd walked along the shore road and sat
down on a grassy bank in the starlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d tell you my story and I will,&rdquo; said
Bert Field, after an awkward pause. &ldquo;I am an
American like yourselves, but I was born in
Japan, while my folks were on a trip around
the world. My folks are dead now and about the
only relative I have in the world is Jabez Trask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabez Trask your relative!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he isn&rsquo;t much of a one, sort of a
third cousin, that&rsquo;s all. I had another relative, a
Robertson, but he is dead too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that owned the old mill?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That mill was in the Robertson family
for years, and they got rich from it, so I am told.
Well, to cut a long story short, when my folks
died they were in New York City and I was
placed in the care of Jabez Trask, who sent me to
a boarding school in Connecticut, the Haley Oaks
School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of that place!&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Very
strict institution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a miserable place!&rdquo; cried Bert Field.
&ldquo;The pupils are half starved and sometimes
beaten. I had more than one row with the master,
and about six months ago I ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said you didn&rsquo;t know where Jabez
Trask was?&rdquo; said Pepper, questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, for he had moved to the country&mdash;to the
mansion he now occupies and which belonged to
the Robertson estate. I tried to locate him, but I
didn&rsquo;t do it openly&mdash;for reasons I&rsquo;ll tell you later.
Well, at last I found him&mdash;and then I found the
old mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand at all what you are
driving at,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;Why all this
secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; answered Bert Field earnestly.
&ldquo;Jabez Trask has a fortune in his keeping. He
pretends that it belongs to him, but I think it
belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">A STORY OF INTEREST</span></h2>
<p>The cadets listened with much interest to what
Bert Field had to say. Here indeed was a
mystery&mdash;yet more of a mystery was to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go into all the details of the case,&rdquo;
went on the strange youth, &ldquo;for it would take too
long. As I said, Jabez Trask sent me to boarding
school. He also went into court and had
himself appointed my guardian. My folks left a
little money and this he handled to suit himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is equal to it&mdash;he looked like a
miser,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a roundabout way I heard about the
Robertson mill and the Robertson fortune. My
mother and the Robertsons were related and I
heard that when William Robertson died he had
expected to leave his property to my mother&rsquo;s side
of the family and not to the Trask side. I wrote
to Jabez Trask about this and he came to see me.
He was furious and said the fortune belonged to
him. He admitted that William Robertson&rsquo;s will
was missing. Nobody knew what had become of
the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sounds like a story book,&rdquo; said Dale, as
Bert Field paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I am telling you only facts.
Well, time slipped by and I was treated worse
and worse at the boarding school. Then, one day
I got a letter from an old woman who had once
been a servant in the Robertson family. She said
she was dying, but before she died she wished to
tell me something. She said she was sure that
William Robertson had made a will leaving his
property to my mother and her heirs. She said
she thought he had gone to the old mill with it, and
that maybe the will was hidden in the mill. She
added that Jabez Trask knew about this will and
was looking for it and probably wanted to destroy
it, so that he could keep possession of the Robertson
fortune. That letter set me to thinking, and one
day I up and ran away from the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To find the will, I suppose,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But first I had to locate the old mill&mdash;and
also locate Jabez Trask, who had moved, as
I told you. You must remember that I was a
stranger in this part of the country and had never
known much about the Robertsons or the old mill.
When I found the old mill I learned that it had the
reputation of being haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I begin to see the truth!&rdquo; cried the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; asked Bert Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabez Trask makes folks believe the old mill
is haunted so that they will keep away. He is
afraid that if folks visit the mill they may, accidentally
or otherwise, find the missing will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly&mdash;or at least, that is how I
figure it out,&rdquo; answered the strange youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Trask plays ghost?&rdquo; asked
Pepper. &ldquo;If he does, I&rsquo;d like to go there and
catch him at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He either does it himself or has somebody
do it for him,&rdquo; answered Bert Field. &ldquo;You must
remember that he is a very queer man,&mdash;very suspicious
as well as miserly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been to his mansion, or to the old
mill yet?&rdquo; questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was near the mansion several times,
once during that thunderstorm, when I saw two of
you, and I have been around the old mill. I tried
to enter it once, when it was dark, but was warned
away by a ghostlike figure. I wasn&rsquo;t much
alarmed by the ghost, but when the figure
threatened to shoot me I walked away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;That proves that the so-called ghost is nothing
but a man,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Well, I was
sure of that before,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you saw me with the rope I had a new
scheme I was going to try to carry out,&rdquo; continued
Bert Field. &ldquo;I have been watching the streams
around here and I came to the conclusion that the
one flowing along where I met you ran under the
old mill. I got the long rope and was going to let
myself down in that opening and see if I couldn&rsquo;t
follow the stream backward to the place. By
doing that&mdash;if it could be done&mdash;I thought I
might be able to get into the old mill without Mr.
Ghost knowing anything about it. Then, if I did
get into the mill, I was going to watch my chance
and hunt for that missing will. The old woman
wrote to me that William Robertson was a great
man for hiding valuable things under the floor.
Maybe that will is under some flooring in the old
mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can get into the mill by that
stream,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But I advise you not to
attempt it. Pepper and I came through that way
and were nearly drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Andy and Pepper related the particulars
of what had occurred to them during the game
of hare and hounds. Bert Field&rsquo;s manner showed
that he was keenly interested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;It fits in!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Whoever is at the mill
is doing his best to keep all other folks away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think we ought to do?&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;We ought to march on the old mill
in a body and demand admittance. They can&rsquo;t
play off that game of ghost on a big crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper. &ldquo;Why,
we can organize a regular company for that purpose
and go there with our rifles! I think Captain
Putnam would let us do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might work, if it wasn&rsquo;t for one thing,&rdquo;
answered Bert Field. &ldquo;Jabez Trask may get so
alarmed that he may burn the old mill down&mdash;and
then the will would be burnt up too. Even as it
is, I am afraid every day that he will set the place
on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;And I
suppose all you care about is that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. The old mill is of no account whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are willing to help you all we can,&rdquo;
said Pepper, after a pause. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d do that
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think I can get into the mill
by way of that stream?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. I&rsquo;d not risk it. I think, if I were
you, and you wish to get into the mill on the sly,
I&rsquo;d wait for a dark night and then crawl up very
cautiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the traps? You fell into one, and there
may be others even more dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I am sure it
will work, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Bert Field with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were near the old mill I noticed that
on the upper side were several very large trees.
One of these trees had its branches hanging directly
over the roof of the main building. Back
of that tree were other trees, stretching down into
the woods. Now, why couldn&rsquo;t some of us climb
into the trees and work our way along from one
limb to another until we reached the tree near the
roof? Then we could get on the roof and from
there into one of the upper windows of the mill.
I don&rsquo;t believe that way is guarded, and if we
worked quietly and in the dark I think we would
give whoever is in the mill a complete surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s a great scheme!&rdquo; cried Pepper.
&ldquo;Let us try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Dale. And then all of the
cadets looked at Bert Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t any of you fellows afraid of the ghost?&rdquo;
asked the strange lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo; added the young
major. &ldquo;But we realize that there may be great
danger in visiting the old mill&mdash;the visit of Andy
and Pepper proves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you all want to go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll take us,&rdquo; was the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you,&rdquo; said Bert Field, with
a little catch in his voice. &ldquo;Say, do you know,
you&rsquo;re the only ones who have been friendly to me
since I ran away from school? Most folks think
me a suspicious character and an odd one. Once I
stopped at a farmhouse, wanting to buy my dinner,
and the woman set her dog at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe they have seen you skulking
around the Trask mansion and in this vicinity
and didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it,&rdquo; answered
Jack kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Bert Field paused. &ldquo;I must say I
like that idea of getting into the old mill by way
of the roof,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And if you want to aid
me, why come ahead. How soon will you be ready
to tackle the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make it to-morrow night,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;We can all get away then. Shall we keep it a
secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Pepper. He saw that Bert
Field was not one to court publicity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;When and where will you meet me?&rdquo; asked the
strange boy.</p>
<p>The matter was discussed for a few minutes, and
then it was decided that the crowd should meet
where they were then standing, at exactly eleven
o&rsquo;clock the following night. The cadets were to
procure pistols and thus arm themselves, and Bert
Field said he would also bring a weapon and likewise
a rope for possible use in climbing. This
settled upon, the cadets and their new friend
separated, and the former hurried back to camp,
leaving the strange lad to go his own way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">CAUGHT IN THE ACT</span></h2>
<p>Reff Ritter and his crowd were exceedingly
angry over the outcome of the launch affair. They
had rowed around in the darkness and the rain
until they were tired, and now they were fairly
aching to pay Jack and his chums back for sending
them on the wild goose chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can fix Ruddy and Ditmore,&rdquo; said
the bully to Coulter, during the time when the
young major and his chums were having their
meeting in the woods with Bert Field. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a plan for getting them into no end of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let me hear what it is,&rdquo; answered
Coulter, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise to keep it a secret, Gus?
This is no ordinary affair, and we can&rsquo;t afford to
be found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can depend on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might take in Paxton, but I won&rsquo;t trust
Sabine. He is too weak-kneed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. Take in Nick and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Paxton was called into the tent
where Ritter and Coulter sat and then the leader
of the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells unfolded his plan to get Jack
and Pepper into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might involve the others,&rdquo; said Ritter.
&ldquo;But Ruddy and Ditmore are the leaders. I&rsquo;m
hoping we can have them both dismissed from the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that would be great!&rdquo; murmured Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would suit me down to the ground,&rdquo; added
Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hated them ever since I came to
Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be kept a secret, remember that,&rdquo;
continued Ritter, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Not a
word to anybody, on your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Coulter and Paxton were at first startled
when Ritter broached his plan and each shook his
head. But gradually the bully won them over, and
they agreed to aid him in the undertaking.</p>
<p>Ritter had learned during the morning that
George Strong had been to Ithaca on business and
had brought back with him a box containing a
collection of rare United States paper money. In
the collection were old five, ten, fifteen, twenty-five
and fifty-cent bills worth many times their real
value, as curiosities. The teacher was writing a
magazine article on the art of paper money engraving
and was studying the collection for that
purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Ritter&rsquo;s scheme was to confiscate the entire
collection of paper money and hide the various
bills in the clothing and other things belonging to
Jack and Pepper. The trick, taken as a whole, was
not a particularly new one, but Ritter was not a
particularly brilliant youth when it came to thinking
out new things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want to work this game?&rdquo; asked
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Strong may not keep the collection longer than
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to do it to-night,&rdquo; said Coulter.
&ldquo;What do you want us to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me and keep watch while I get the
stuff. Then both of you can help me stow the bills
away in Ruddy and Ditmore&rsquo;s clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plotters waited until all was quiet and then
stole through the camp to where was located the
tent occupied by George Strong. Here they came
to a halt at the rear of the tent and listened
intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; whispered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you look out that you don&rsquo;t wake him
up,&rdquo; answered Coulter in a voice that shook from
nervousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful. If you see anybody coming
give a low whistle,&rdquo; continued the bully. &ldquo;Remember
to look in every direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter and Paxton promised to keep their eyes
open, and as silently as a shadow Reff Ritter
walked around to the front of the tent, untied the
flap and peered inside.</p>
<p>All was dark, yet in a faint way he discerned
George Strong resting on a cot and sleeping
soundly. He tiptoed his way into the tent and felt
around.</p>
<p>He knew the collection of rare paper money
was in a square wooden box with a brass handle.
It rested on a campchair close to the head of the
cot.</p>
<p>As Ritter touched the wooden box the teacher
gave a heavy sigh and turned over. With his heart
in his throat the bully crouched down on the floor
in a corner. But the teacher did not awaken, and
soon commenced to breathe as regularly as ever.</p>
<p>Once Ritter had the wooden box in his grasp
he lost no time in quitting the tent. As he came
outside Paxton gave a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guard is coming this way&mdash;lay low!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys threw themselves flat on the
ground and remained there, scarcely daring to
breathe. It was the corporal of the guard who was
approaching, and he had another cadet with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;You say you saw somebody sneaking around
here?&rdquo; asked the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take a walk through the whole
camp,&rdquo; said the corporal. &ldquo;You can go back to
your post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard left, and the corporal walked off in
the direction of the tent occupied by Captain Putnam.
Then he went down one of the company
streets, and at last disappeared into his own
quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that was a close shave!&rdquo; muttered Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a miss is as good as a mile,&rdquo; answered
Ritter, coolly. &ldquo;Come on, if we want to get some
sleep to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m beginning to think this is a dangerous
piece of business,&rdquo; was Paxton&rsquo;s comment. His
teeth were chattering, but not from cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t back out now,&rdquo; answered the bully,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we are found out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be found out&mdash;unless you blab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll not say a word,&rdquo; answered Paxton
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come into the tent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>They entered the tent occupied by the bully, and
Coulter lit a candle. By the faint light afforded
Ritter opened the wooden box, took out the paper
money and divided it into three parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll take my share and hide it in Ruddy&rsquo;s
things,&rdquo; said Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want us to do?&rdquo; asked
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your share in Ditmore&rsquo;s clothing and in
his dress-suit case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing he is awake?&rdquo; asked Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be asleep and snoring like a
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. But if he is awake I&rsquo;ll not go in,&rdquo;
said Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be chicken-hearted, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our share,
you do yours,&rdquo; he added, to Ritter.</p>
<p>The cadets separated, each with the old paper
money stuck in the bosom of his coat, where he
could get at it easily. Ritter hurried directly to
the tent occupied by the young major of the school
battalion.</p>
<p>He knew he must act with caution and so
listened closely at the flap of the tent. Not a
sound came from within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he is out?&rdquo; mused the bully and
opened the flap cautiously. Then he saw in a dim
way that the tent was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is off on a lark,&rdquo; said Ritter to himself.
&ldquo;Well, so much the better, although I&rsquo;d like
to put some of the money in the uniform he is
wearing. When he is found out he&rsquo;ll have to
explain where he has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the tent was empty Ritter did not hesitate
to light a candle he carried. By the rays thus
afforded he found Jack&rsquo;s dress-suit case and in it
stuffed some of the paper money. Then he took
the young major&rsquo;s extra uniform and placed some
of the bills in the pockets and lining of that. He
placed the last of the bills under the sheet on the
cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, what are you up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came so unexpectedly that the
bully jumped as if shot. He was on the point of
blowing out the candle when it was snatched from
his grasp. Swinging around, he found himself
confronted by Jack, just returning from the conference
with Bert Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the bully. He
was so dumbfounded he did not know what to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hide on my cot, under the
sheet?&rdquo; went on the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you put something there. What was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put anything there,&rdquo; answered Ritter
stubbornly. &ldquo;You let me go!&rdquo; And he tried to
brush past Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my tent and you have no right in it,&rdquo;
cried the young major. &ldquo;You give an account of
yourself,&rdquo; and now he caught the bully tightly by
the arm.</p>
<p>Hardly had he done this when with a cry of
commingled alarm and rage the bully struck out,
hitting Jack in the face. Then he broke loose,
blew out the light, and ran out of the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">CAPTAIN PUTNAM HAS HIS SAY</span></h2>
<p>The young major was surprised, and for one
instant he did not know what to do. But then he
recovered his wits and dashed out after Ritter.
He caught the bully making his way back of the
tent, and putting out his foot sent the fellow
sprawling. Then, before Ritter could arise, Jack
sat on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you le&mdash;let m-me up!&rdquo; gasped Ritter,
who all but had the breath knocked out of him.
&ldquo;Le&mdash;let me up, do yo&mdash;you he&mdash;hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you up when you explain, not before!&rdquo;
cried Jack. &ldquo;You were doing something in my
tent. I want to know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Ritter could frame a reply&mdash;and it is
doubtful if he had one ready&mdash;a cry came from
the tent occupied by Pepper, Andy and Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; came in the voice of The
Imp. &ldquo;Stand where you are, Coulter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go! Please let me go!&rdquo; pleaded the
voice of Nick Paxton. &ldquo;Oh, let me go this time
and I&rsquo;ll never do wrong again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, so the rest of your crowd are in this,&rdquo;
said Jack to Ritter. &ldquo;I might have known it.
Come with me, and don&rsquo;t you try to run away,
or I&rsquo;ll give you the worst licking you ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young major allowed the bully to get up
and caught him tightly by the arm. The two
walked over to the other tent, and there beheld
Coulter and Paxton surrounded by Andy, Dale
and Pepper. Paxton was trembling as if with the
ague, and Coulter was also much disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We caught them in our tent at our things,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;At least, they were at my things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ritter was in my tent, putting something
in my bed,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter dropped something. Make a light and
see what it was,&rdquo; suggested Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make a noise! You&rsquo;ll have the
guard down on us! And Captain Putnam and
Mr. Strong!&rdquo; cried Paxton, hoarsely. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want to get caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making as much noise as anybody,&rdquo;
answered Ritter. He was much disturbed, but
tried not to show it. &ldquo;We were only playing a
little joke,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Just to square up for
that launch affair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Andy had struck a match and lit a lantern that
was handy. He cast the rays on the flooring of the
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is what Coulter dropped,&rdquo; said Dale, and
picked the object up. &ldquo;A twenty-five cent bill, I
declare! Where did that old-time money come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is another bill&mdash;a ten-cent one,&rdquo; added
Pepper, taking it from his suit-case, which Coulter
had not had time to close. &ldquo;Where did they get
this stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see those bills,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Keep
your eyes on Ritter as well as Coulter and Paxton,&rdquo;
he added, to his chums.</p>
<p>The young major took the paper money and
examined it with care. He gave a start and then
turned sternly to Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that money come from, Ritter?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; returned the bully as coolly as
he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took it from Mr. Strong&rsquo;s collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure of it. Shall I call Mr. Strong and
find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried Paxton. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call him!
Don&rsquo;t call anybody, please!&rdquo; And he fell on his
knees before the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Paxton, tell me the whole truth of this,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say a word, Nick!&rdquo; cried Ritter.
&ldquo;Remember your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but if they call Captain Putnam&mdash;&rdquo;
stammered the frightened cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our word is as good as theirs,&rdquo; answered the
bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are willing to tell falsehoods to get
out of this affair, eh?&rdquo; said Jack, in disgust.</p>
<p>To this Ritter did not reply. Coulter looked at
Paxton and then at the other cadets. Evidently he
was trying to think out a way to escape punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, in a low, nervous voice.
&ldquo;If we tell the truth about this, and fix everything
as it was before, will you let us go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;You tell us
what you were up to first. I know this paper
money belongs to the collection Mr. Strong
brought from Ithaca. I saw it this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we were doing was to play a trick on you,
and Mr. Strong,&rdquo; went on Coulter. &ldquo;We took the
old paper money and hid it in your tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you were going to put the blame of
taking it on us,&rdquo; broke in Pepper quickly. &ldquo;A
fine trick, I must say! Why, Mr. Strong might
have had us locked up for stealing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a trick!&rdquo; cried Paxton. &ldquo;We
would have explained it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&mdash;but most likely not,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;It was a dirty trick, to say the least. You had no
business to touch the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t preach to us, Andy Snow!&rdquo;
cried Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t touched the money!&rdquo;
whined Paxton. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do it in the
first place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me sick!&rdquo; roared Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in a mess, and now we have to get
out of it,&rdquo; muttered Coulter. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here
all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better collect all that money first,&rdquo; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be the best plan,&rdquo; said a voice
from the doorway of the tent, and looking around
all of the cadets saw George Strong confronting
them. The teacher had donned his long mackintosh
and a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Strong!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume none of you expected to see me,&rdquo;
went on the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; stammered Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to wake up, and hearing you talking
thought I would get up and see what was the
matter. I listened to your conversation and found
out that the collection of paper money I brought
with me to-day has been&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;appropriated
or borrowed? That collection is
very valuable and is not mine, and I am under a
promise to return it intact. I wish you would return
the money to me, every bill, and each in good
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong, I wish to state that neither Ditmore,
Snow, Blackmore nor myself had anything
to do with the taking of that money,&rdquo; said the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I judged, by the talk I overheard,&rdquo;
answered the teacher, and his words gave Jack and
his chums great relief.</p>
<p>More lanterns were lit, and Coulter, Paxton
and Ritter were forced to hunt up all the bills,
both in the young major&rsquo;s tent and in that occupied
by his friends. The corporal of the guard came
along, to find out what was going on, but when he
saw the teacher in charge he retired.</p>
<p>It took some time to collect all the paper money,
and while this was going on Mr. Strong was
grimly silent. He looked over the collection with
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every bill seems to be here,&rdquo; he said, at last.
&ldquo;Now all of you young gentlemen can go to bed.
In the morning I will investigate further, and
report to Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Much worried, Ritter, Coulter and Paxton withdrew
to their quarters. They had been caught in
their own trap, and wondered what punishment
would be meted out to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to answer a few questions,
too,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that we were
found fully dressed when we should have been in
bed and asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;But, nevertheless,
I am mighty glad Mr. Strong came in as
he did. If he hadn&rsquo;t Ritter and his gang might
have gotten us into no end of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter is a bad egg&mdash;I wish we were rid of
him,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>None of the boys slept well that night. In
the morning roll call and parade were held as
usual, and then word was sent out for all the
boys who knew about the affair of the night
before to report to Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>Jack and his chums were first called on to
tell their story, and they frankly admitted that
they had left the camp to talk to an outsider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy is a stranger here and he wanted
aid, and we said we would help him if we
could,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;We did not
go on any lark or play any tricks. We simply sat
and talked, and then came back to camp.&rdquo; And
this testimony was corroborated by Jack&rsquo;s chums.
Then all told how they had discovered Ritter,
Coulter and Paxton hiding the paper money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>After that Mr. Strong told his story, and then
the bully and his cronies had their say. Ritter
tried to evade the truth, but Coulter and Paxton
broke down and confessed all, and pleaded for
mercy.</p>
<p>After the hearing Captain Putnam read the
cadets a stern lecture and forbid their going out
of camp without permission. Then he proceeded
to lecture Ritter and his followers separately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have done was despicable,&rdquo; said the
head of the school. &ldquo;I did not imagine any of the
cadets could be so mean. I will think the matter
over, and this noon I will let you know what your
punishment is to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">AT THE HAUNTED MILL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think Ritter and his cronies will catch it
rather heavily,&rdquo; remarked Andy, as he and his
friends walked away from Captain Putnam&rsquo;s
quarters. &ldquo;Well, it will serve them right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have gotten ourselves in trouble,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;We have promised not to leave camp
unless we have permission to do so. How are we
to get off to go to the old mill with Bert Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might ask Captain Putnam for permission,&rdquo;
said Pepper &ldquo;But I doubt if he would let
us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning passed, and at noon the lads heard
that Ritter, Coulter and Paxton had been assigned
to extra guard duty. More than this, they were cut
off from leaving the camp at any time and were
also cut off from taking any part in all athletic
contests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a blow for Ritter,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;He
wanted to row in a race and wanted to play
another game of ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can be thankful he wasn&rsquo;t expelled,&rdquo;
came from the young major.</p>
<p>What to do about meeting Bert Field the cadets
did not know. They wanted to keep their word
with the youth and they did not desire to break
their promise to Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to go to the captain and
tell him about the old mill,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But I
am almost sure he won&rsquo;t let us go there, especially
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he might let us go in the daytime,&rdquo;
returned Pepper.</p>
<p>The matter was solved in a most unexpected
manner. From the Fords came in an invitation
to visit them at their hotel that evening, when a
well-known magician was going to give an entertainment
for the benefit of the guests. Mr. Ford
enclosed a note to Captain Putnam, asking the
master of the school to give Jack, Pepper, Andy
and Dale leave of absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! I guess we&rsquo;ll get off!&rdquo; cried Pepper,
and lost no time in handing the note to Captain
Putnam. Mr. Ford was to call for the cadets in
a launch, and they were given permission to take
in the entertainment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>It must be confessed that the boys did not enjoy
the entertainment as much as they might have
under other circumstances. They liked the show,
and the girls treated them as cordially as ever, but
they could not help but glance at the clock, and
wonder if they could get away in time to meet Bert
Field. At last Laura noticed Jack&rsquo;s nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he answered frankly. &ldquo;We have
another engagement&mdash;a secret one&mdash;an hour from
now. It&rsquo;s something Captain Putnam doesn&rsquo;t
know anything about&mdash;something just among us
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;a feast or hazing, or something
like that!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see that you
get off to it, and when it is over you&rsquo;ll have to
write to me and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<p>Laura explained to her sister, and the two
managed it so that the cadets left the hotel without
having Mr. Ford take them back to camp in
the launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the place where we are to meet Bert
Field,&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I hope we find him on
hand. I am just in the mood for an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get it&mdash;if we get in the old mill,&rdquo;
answered Andy, grimly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what
happened before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not forgetting it,&rdquo; answered The Imp,
and felt of the pistol he had brought along. He
had no desire to do any shooting, but he was resolved
to do his best to save himself from bodily
harm.</p>
<p>Their numerous tramps in that vicinity had
made them more or less familiar with the roads,
and they took as direct a course as possible for the
spot where they were to meet Bert. He was on
hand and glad to see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you couldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
made up my mind to wait just an hour and then
go it alone. Here is the rope. Are you armed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But little more was said, for the boys were
afraid that somebody going to or coming from the
old mill might hear them. Like a file of Indians
they walked through the woods in the direction of
the dilapidated structure that was located on the
bank of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a notion that Jabez Trask is at the
mill,&rdquo; whispered Bert, when they came within view
of the place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching around his
house all afternoon, but he was nowhere in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not go very close to the old mill, but
halted at the foot of the trees before mentioned.
Andy boosted the others into a tree and then
climbed up himself. Then the acrobatic youth led
the way, from one tree to another. All moved
closer to the mill without making any noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>There was no moon, but the stars were shining
brightly, and by the light they saw the building
loom up before them. Not a light was to be seen,
and the only sound that reached their ears was the
roaring of the Falls some distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, be careful!&rdquo; whispered Andy, as he
moved out on the end of a limb. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a
noise when you drop on the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he went out the limb bent beneath his weight
until it rested on the shingles of the roof. He
alighted on the top of the mill with ease, and one
after another the others followed.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="The limb bent beneath his weight." width="500" height="790" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">The limb bent beneath his weight.</span></span></p>
</div>
<p>The roof was of the low, gabled sort, with several
windows at either end of the building, just below
the top. Andy crawled over the shingles with the
ease of a trained athlete and looked over the edge.
One of the windows was within three feet of him
and he noted with satisfaction that one of the
sashes was completely gone and the other was
minus its panes of glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to break any glass&mdash;it would make
such a noise,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now then, the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quickly made fast and Andy went
down and crawled through the window into the
loft of the mill. The others came after him.
Then the five boys stood in a circle, almost holding
their breath, and wondering what they had best do
next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are in the place anyway,&rdquo; murmured
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they haven&rsquo;t dropped us into the
river either,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the hearts of the four
cadets thumped wildly in their bosoms. They
realized that they were in a dangerous situation,
and there was no telling what would happen next.
Bert Field was strangely self-possessed, even
though his nerves were at a high tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I think it is my place
to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll watch out, and do all we can to
protect you, and ourselves, in case of trouble,&rdquo;
answered Jack.</p>
<p>Having listened for several minutes, the boys
grew bolder and Bert Field lit a small bullseye
lantern he had brought along. By the aid of the
light, they tiptoed their way across the loft floor
and down a narrow pair of stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Bert, suddenly, and came to a
halt. He shut off the light, and all came to a halt
and strained their ears.</p>
<p>From a distance came a murmur of voices.
Three men were talking in one of the rooms of the
old mill. Then the boys saw a ray of light shining
under a closed door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are in that room,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to the door and listen to what they have to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved on and so did the cadets, all anxious
to listen to the conversation. Now the boys were
certain they had only human beings to deal with
they felt better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you, Vidder, to go out on the road and
watch,&rdquo; came in the voice of Jabez Trask. &ldquo;Put
on that cowhide with the horns to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;but I am pretty tired,&rdquo; croaked
the voice of an old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;you can sleep all day to-morrow,&rdquo;
answered Jabez Trask. &ldquo;You, Jepson,
guard all the doors. If anybody comes, why&mdash;the
trap&mdash;you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo; answered another voice, shrill
and harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to make another hunt to-night,&rdquo;
went on Jabez Trask. &ldquo;I must find that will.
That boy is watching me and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you would find the will,&rdquo; growled the
old man called Vidder. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d get our
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. Now begone, so I can get to
work,&rdquo; went on Jabez Trask.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>The men in the room began to move, and the
cadets and Bert crouched out of sight behind
some boxes and barrels. Then two of the men
came out and left the mill. A moment later Jabez
Trask appeared, lantern in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow up that new clue to-night,&rdquo; the boys
heard the miser mutter. &ldquo;Let me see, what was
it? Third stone from the top, sixth stone from the
left. William Robertson wrote that in the note-book,
and it must mean something. If I can get
that will, and destroy it, the fortune will be mine,
all mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lantern in hand, Jabez Trask crossed the room
and entered another apartment. The boys heard
him going down a flight of stone steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going after him,&rdquo; whispered Bert,
excitedly. &ldquo;He thinks he is going to locate that
will! Maybe I got here just in time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">A FIND OF IMPORTANCE&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise&mdash;or you may spoil it all,&rdquo;
whispered Jack.</p>
<p>He caught Bert by the arm, and as silently as
shadows the pair followed the old miser down the
flight of stone steps, and the others came after
them. They saw that Jabez Trask had entered a
room that was almost a vault, being built of stone
and about ten feet square. The miser had placed
his lantern on the floor and was counting the stones
on one of the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; the boys heard him mutter
to himself. &ldquo;This wall has eighty-six stones in it.
I want the one with seventy-six&mdash;seventy-six, like
the Revolutionary year. Let me see,&rdquo; and he commenced
to count the stones in another of the four
walls.</p>
<p>This, too, was a disappointment, and then he went
at the third. Then he gave a chuckle of satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-six, clean and clear!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;This must be the wall. Now then, sixth stone
from the left, third stone from the top. Ha!
here it is! Now to find out what is behind it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought forth a chisel and commenced to pry
on the stone. It came from the wall with ease,
revealing an opening behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box! The box at last!&rdquo; almost shrieked
the miser, and putting his arm into the opening
he drew forth a black, metal box, covered with
dirt and mildew.</p>
<p>Bert Field uttered a cry, he could not help it
But in his excitement Jabez Trask did not notice
the noise. The miser fell on his knees on the
dirt floor and commenced to fumble with the opening
of the box. Then the lid flew back and out
tumbled half a dozen legal-looking documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will! At last!&rdquo; almost shrieked the man,
and fairly kissed one of the papers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it
over first, to make sure it is the one, and then I&rsquo;ll
burn it. Then the Robertson fortune will be mine,
all mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel! Give me that will!&rdquo; cried
Bert Field, and before the others could stop him,
even had they wished to do so, he was on top of
Jabez Trask and had hurled the miser on his back.
The man clung to the paper desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that will!&rdquo; repeated Bert. &ldquo;It is
mine,&mdash;I have a right to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; screamed Jabez Trask. &ldquo;Vidder!
Jepson! Where are you? Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to struggle, and the will was in
danger of being torn to pieces, when Jack and
Pepper rushed forward and caught Jabez Trask
by the arms. Then Bert got a good hold on the
legal document and twisted it free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take that! It is mine&mdash;all mine!&rdquo;
moaned the miser, and suddenly his eyes commenced
to roll, as if he was going to have a fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the box and the other papers!&rdquo; cried the
young major to Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if there is anything
more in that opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran forward and felt into the opening, only
to find it empty. By this time footsteps were
sounding overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men are coming!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ve got what you want we had better get out
of here, unless you want to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay, now I have the will and
the other private papers,&rdquo; answered Bert. &ldquo;Come
on&mdash;they may try to take the papers away from
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys ran from the vault and across the
lower floor of the old mill. Then an outer door
opened and the man called Vidder appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>He presented a comical appearance and under
ordinary circumstances the boys would have
laughed at him. Over one shoulder dangled a
cow&rsquo;s hide and over the other a pair of fearful
looking horns. In one hand he carried a light,
placed in an object formed to represent a large
human skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked, when Bert
ran full tilt into him, hurling him flat. Then the
youth ran through the doorway, and the cadets
followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of traps!&rdquo; sang out Pepper. &ldquo;Let us
keep in a string and join hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, Bert forming one end of the
line and Dale the other. Once they stepped on a
platform that threatened to go down with them,
but they were on the alert and got off in a hurry.
Then they dashed straight into the woods, where
they knew the men would have difficulty in following
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we have accomplished what we
set out to do,&rdquo; said Jack, when they finally came
to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; cried Bert. &ldquo;And I do not
know how to thank you enough,&rdquo; he added,
warmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to read that will over and see
if it is really in favor of your mother?&rdquo; asked
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light was made, and all of the boys looked
over the document with care. The will left small
sums of money to various servants and employees
and then the bulk of the Robertson estate went to
Bert&rsquo;s mother and her heirs&mdash;the only heir now
being Bert himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I would advise,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;You come to camp with us, Bert. You can sleep
with me. In the morning we&rsquo;ll lay this whole
matter before Captain Putnam and ask his advice.
I am sure he will tell you what is best to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have Jabez Trask arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But it will be punishment enough
for that miser if he has to let go his hold on the
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert agreed to follow the advice of the young
major, and before long they reached the camp, and
Jack took the strange lad to his tent with him,
and gave him the use of a vacant cot.</p>
<p>It was certainly a meeting of importance that
occurred in Captain Putnam&rsquo;s headquarters the
next morning, after breakfast and drill. Bert told
his story in full, and the cadets had their say, and
then the will and the other documents were
brought forth and looked over with care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you need is a good lawyer,&rdquo; said the
master of the school to Bert. &ldquo;This Jabez Trask
is undoubtedly a scheming rascal who will do all
in his power to keep you out of your own. If you
wish I&rsquo;ll take you to Rochester and introduce you
to a legal gentleman who will take care of all your
interests and have the courts mete out to Trask
the punishment he deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suited Bert, and the journey to Rochester
was taken the next day, Jack and Pepper accompanying
the captain and the Robertson heir. A
long conference with a first-class lawyer was held,
and immediate steps were taken to place Bert in
possession of his own.</p>
<p>When efforts to locate Jabez Trask were made
there was a surprise. The miser had closed up his
mansion and fled. Nor could the two men, Vidder
and Jepson, be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evidence of their guilt,&rdquo; said the lawyer
to Bert. &ldquo;I do not think you will have any difficulty
in establishing your claim to the fortune.&rdquo;
And the legal gentleman was right. Bert obtained
the fortune with but little trouble, and he was
correspondingly happy. The courts appointed a
well-known business man of Ithaca as his guardian,
and this guardian told Bert the best thing he
could do would be to go to some first-class school
and finish his education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just what I want to do,&rdquo; said Bert.
&ldquo;And the school I want to go to is Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good selection,&rdquo; was his guardian&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;A fine school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one in which I have some warm friends,&rdquo;
added Bert earnestly.</p>
<p>Bert&rsquo;s coming to Putnam Hall pleased Jack
and his chums, and they gave him a royal welcome.
Before this time the repairs to the school
building were finished, and the encampment at
Lake Caboy came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had a dandy time camping out,&rdquo;
said Jack to his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lots of adventures,&rdquo; added Pepper.
&ldquo;Wonder if we&rsquo;ll ever have any more?&rdquo; They
did have more adventures, and what they were I
shall relate in another volume, to be called &ldquo;The
Putnam Hall Mystery; or, The School Chums&rsquo;
Strange Discovery.&rdquo; In that book we shall meet
all our old friends again, and also learn something
more of the doings of Reff Ritter and his cronies.</p>
<p>It was an ideal day when the cadets marched
back to Putnam Hall. The sun shone brightly
overhead, and most of the lads were in the best of
spirits. The Fords came over to the camp to see
our friends take up the march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you glad to go back?&rdquo; asked Laura,
of the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Putnam Hall
seems like home, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Captain Putnam gave the order to break
camp. The drums rolled and the boys set up a
cheer. The young major stepped in front of the
two companies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Shoulder
arms! Forward march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drums sounded, the flag floated out on the
breeze, and the march for the Hall was begun. The
visitors gave a shout of farewell, and the girls
waved their handkerchiefs. And here for the
present we will leave the Putnam Hall cadets, and
say good-bye.</p>
